    """Combine regions separated by weight less than threshold.

    Given an image's labels and its RAG, output new labels by
    combining regions whose nodes are separated by a weight less
    than the given threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : ndarray
        The array of labels.
    rag : RAG
        The region adjacency graph.
    thresh : float
        The threshold. Regions connected by edges with smaller weights are
        combined.
    in_place : bool
        If set, modifies `rag` in place. The function will remove the edges
        with weights less that `thresh`. If set to `False` the function
        makes a copy of `rag` before proceeding.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from skimage import data, segmentation, graph
    >>> img = data.astronaut()
    >>> labels = segmentation.slic(img)
    >>> rag = graph.rag_mean_color(img, labels)
    >>> new_labels = graph.cut_threshold(labels, rag, 10)

    Given an image's labels and its similarity RAG, recursively perform

    that cannot be cut further are assigned a unique label in the
    output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : ndarray
        The array of labels.
    rag : RAG
        The region adjacency graph.
    thresh : float
        The threshold. A subgraph won't be further subdivided if the
        value of the N-cut exceeds `thresh`.
    num_cuts : int
        The number or N-cuts to perform before determining the optimal one.
    in_place : bool
        If set, modifies `rag` in place. For each node `n` the function will
        set a new attribute ``rag.nodes[n]['ncut label']``.
    max_edge : float, optional
        The maximum possible value of an edge in the RAG. This corresponds to
        an edge between identical regions. This is used to put self
        edges in the RAG.
    rng : {`numpy.random.Generator`, int}, optional
        Pseudo-random number generator.
        By default, a PCG64 generator is used (see :func:`numpy.random.default_rng`).
        If `rng` is an int, it is used to seed the generator.

        The `rng` is used to determine the starting point
        of `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh`.
