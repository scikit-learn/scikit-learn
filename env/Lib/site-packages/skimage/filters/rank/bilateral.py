"""Approximate bilateral rank filter for local (custom kernel) mean.

The local histogram is computed using a sliding window similar to the method
described in [1]_.

The pixel neighborhood is defined by:

* the given footprint (structuring element)
* an interval [g-s0, g+s1] in graylevel around g the processed pixel graylevel

The kernel is flat (i.e. each pixel belonging to the neighborhood contributes
equally).

Result image is 8-/16-bit or double with respect to the input image and the
rank filter operation.

    """Apply a flat kernel bilateral filter.

    This is an edge-preserving and noise reducing denoising filter. It averages
    pixels based on their spatial closeness and radiometric similarity.

    Spatial closeness is measured by considering only the local pixel
    neighborhood given by a footprint (structuring element).

    Radiometric similarity is defined by the graylevel interval [g-s0, g+s1]
    where g is the current pixel graylevel.

    Only pixels belonging to the footprint and having a graylevel inside this
    interval are averaged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : 2-D array (uint8, uint16)
        Input image.
    footprint : 2-D array
        The neighborhood expressed as a 2-D array of 1's and 0's.
    out : 2-D array (same dtype as input)
        If None, a new array is allocated.
    mask : ndarray
        Mask array that defines (>0) area of the image included in the local
        neighborhood. If None, the complete image is used (default).
    shift_x, shift_y : int
        Offset added to the footprint center point. Shift is bounded to the
        footprint sizes (center must be inside the given footprint).
    s0, s1 : int
        Define the [s0, s1] interval around the grayvalue of the center pixel
        to be considered for computing the value.

    out : 2-D array (same dtype as input image)
