"""extrema.py - local minima and maxima

This module provides functions to find local maxima and minima of an image.
Here, local maxima (minima) are defined as connected sets of pixels with equal
gray level which is strictly greater (smaller) than the gray level of all
pixels in direct neighborhood of the connected set. In addition, the module
provides the related functions h-maxima and h-minima.

    The local maxima are defined as connected sets of pixels with equal
    gray level strictly greater than the gray level of all pixels in direct
    neighborhood of the set.

    A local maximum M of height h is a local maximum for which
    there is at least one path joining M with an equal or higher local maximum
    on which the minimal value is f(M) - h (i.e. the values along the path
    are not decreasing by more than h with respect to the maximum's value)
    and no path to an equal or higher local maximum for which the minimal
    value is greater.

    The global maxima of the image are also found by this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        The input image for which the maxima are to be calculated.
    h : unsigned integer
        The minimal height of all extracted maxima.
    footprint : ndarray, optional
        The neighborhood expressed as an n-D array of 1's and 0's.
        Default is the ball of radius 1 according to the maximum norm
        (i.e. a 3x3 square for 2D images, a 3x3x3 cube for 3D images, etc.)

    Returns
    -------
    h_max : ndarray
        The local maxima of height >= h and the global maxima.
        The resulting image is a binary image, where pixels belonging to
        the determined maxima take value 1, the others take value 0.

    The local maxima are defined as connected sets of pixels with equal gray

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        An n-dimensional array.
    footprint : ndarray, optional
        The footprint (structuring element) used to determine the neighborhood
        of each evaluated pixel (``True`` denotes a connected pixel). It must
        be a boolean array and have the same number of dimensions as `image`.
        If neither `footprint` nor `connectivity` are given, all adjacent
        pixels are considered as part of the neighborhood.
    connectivity : int, optional
        A number used to determine the neighborhood of each evaluated pixel.
        Adjacent pixels whose squared distance from the center is less than or
        equal to `connectivity` are considered neighbors. Ignored if
        `footprint` is not None.
    indices : bool, optional
        If True, the output will be a tuple of one-dimensional arrays
        representing the indices of local maxima in each dimension. If False,
        the output will be a boolean array with the same shape as `image`.
    allow_borders : bool, optional
        If true, plateaus that touch the image border are valid maxima.

    Returns
    -------
    maxima : ndarray or tuple[ndarray]
        If `indices` is false, a boolean array with the same shape as `image`
        is returned with ``True`` indicating the position of local maxima
        (``False`` otherwise). If `indices` is true, a tuple of one-dimensional
        arrays containing the coordinates (indices) of all found maxima.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        If `allow_borders` is false and any dimension of the given `image` is
        shorter than 3 samples, maxima can't exist and a warning is shown.

    Notes
    -----
    This function operates on the following ideas:

    1. Make a first pass over the image's last dimension and flag candidates
       for local maxima by comparing pixels in only one direction.
       If the pixels aren't connected in the last dimension all pixels are
       flagged as candidates instead.

    For each candidate:

    2. Perform a flood-fill to find all connected pixels that have the same
       gray value and are part of the plateau.
    3. Consider the connected neighborhood of a plateau: if no bordering sample
       has a higher gray level, mark the plateau as a definite local maximum.
