            customdata
                Assigns extra data each datum. This may be
                useful when listening to hover, click and
                selection events. Note that, "scatter" traces
                also appends customdata items in the markers

                Determines which trace information appear on
                hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no
                information is displayed upon hovering. But, if
                `none` is set, click and hover events are still
                fired.
            hoverinfosrc

                instance or dict with compatible properties
            legend
                Sets the reference to a legend to show this
                trace in. References to these legends are
                "legend", "legend2", "legend3", etc. Settings
                for these legends are set in the layout, under
                `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`, etc.
            legendgroup
                Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces
                and shapes part of the same legend group
                hide/show at the same time when toggling legend

                properties
            legendrank
                Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and
                groups with smaller ranks are presented on
                top/left side while with "reversed"
                `legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right
                side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that
                you can use ranks less than 1000 to place
                certain items before all unranked items, and
                ranks greater than 1000 to go after all
                unranked items. When having unranked or equal
                rank items shapes would be displayed after
                traces i.e. according to their order in data
                and layout.
            legendwidth
                Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the
                legend for this trace.
            line
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.ohlc.Line`

            low
                Sets the low values.
            lowsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `low`.
            meta
                Assigns extra meta information associated with
                this trace that can be used in various text
                attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`,
                graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`,
                annotation `text` `rangeselector`,
                `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all
                support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
                values in an attribute in the same trace,
                simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index
                or key of the `meta` item in question. To
                access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use
                `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or
                key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.
            metasrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `meta`.
            name
                Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as
                the legend item and on hover.
            opacity
                Sets the opacity of the trace.
            open
                Sets the open values.
            opensrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `open`.
            selectedpoints
                Array containing integer indices of selected
                points. Has an effect only for traces that
                support selections. Note that an empty array
                means an empty selection where the `unselected`
                are turned on for all points, whereas, any
                other non-array values means no selection all
                where the `selected` and `unselected` styles
                have no effect.
            showlegend
                Determines whether or not an item corresponding
                to this trace is shown in the legend.
            stream
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.ohlc.Stream`
                instance or dict with compatible properties
            text
                Sets hover text elements associated with each
                sample point. If a single string, the same
                string appears over all the data points. If an
                array of string, the items are mapped in order
                to this trace's sample points.
            textsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `text`.
            tickwidth
                Sets the width of the open/close tick marks
                relative to the "x" minimal interval.
            uid
                Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide
                object constancy between traces during
                animations and transitions.
            uirevision
                Controls persistence of some user-driven
                changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in
                `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable:
                true` modifications such as `name` and
                `colorbar.title`. Defaults to
                `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-
                driven trace attribute changes are controlled
                by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
                controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
                `selectedpoints` is controlled by
                `layout.selectionrevision`, and
                `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config:
                {editable: true}`) is controlled by
                `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
                tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on
                trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your
                app can add/remove traces before the end of the
                `data` array, such that the same trace has a
                different index, you can still preserve user-
                driven changes if you give each trace a `uid`
                that stays with it as it moves.
            visible
                Determines whether or not this trace is
                visible. If "legendonly", the trace is not
                drawn, but can appear as a legend item
                (provided that the legend itself is visible).
            x
                Sets the x coordinates. If absent, linear
                coordinate will be generated.
            xaxis
                Sets a reference between this trace's x
                coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x"
                (the default value), the x coordinates refer to
                `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x coordinates
                refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
            xcalendar
                Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date
                data.
            xhoverformat
                Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`
                using d3 formatting mini-languages which are
                very similar to those in Python. For numbers,
                see: https://github.com/d3/d3-
                format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates
                see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two
                items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of
                the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"
                for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display
                *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
                formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
            xperiod
                Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date".
                Sets the period positioning in milliseconds or
                "M<n>" on the x axis. Special values in the
                form of "M<n>" could be used to declare the
                number of months. In this case `n` must be a
                positive integer.
            xperiod0
                Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date".
                Sets the base for period positioning in
                milliseconds or date string on the x0 axis.
                When `x0period` is round number of weeks, the
                `x0period0` by default would be on a Sunday
                i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
                2000-01-01.
            xperiodalignment
                Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date".
                Sets the alignment of data points on the x
                axis.
            xsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `x`.
            yaxis
                Sets a reference between this trace's y
                coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y"
                (the default value), the y coordinates refer to
                `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y coordinates
                refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
            yhoverformat
                Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`
                using d3 formatting mini-languages which are
                very similar to those in Python. For numbers,
                see: https://github.com/d3/d3-
                format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates
                see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two
                items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of
                the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"
                for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with

                *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
                formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
            zorder
                Sets the layer on which this trace is
                displayed, relative to other SVG traces on the
                same subplot. SVG traces with higher `zorder`
                appear in front of those with lower `zorder`.
