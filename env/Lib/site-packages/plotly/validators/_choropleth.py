            autocolorscale
                Determines whether the colorscale is a default
                palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette
                determined by `colorscale`. In case
                `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale`
                is true, the default palette will be chosen
                according to whether numbers in the `color`
                array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
            coloraxis
                Sets a reference to a shared color axis.
                References to these shared color axes are
                "coloraxis", "coloraxis2", "coloraxis3", etc.
                Settings for these shared color axes are set in
                the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
                `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple
                color scales can be linked to the same color
                axis.

                r` instance or dict with compatible properties
            colorscale
                Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an
                array containing arrays mapping a normalized
                value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named
                color string. At minimum, a mapping for the
                lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required.
                For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1,
                'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the
                colorscale in color space, use `zmin` and
                `zmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a
                palette name string of the following list: Blac
                kbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Gree
                ns,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,R
                eds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd.
            customdata
                Assigns extra data each datum. This may be
                useful when listening to hover, click and
                selection events. Note that, "scatter" traces
                also appends customdata items in the markers
                DOM elements
            customdatasrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `customdata`.
            featureidkey
                Sets the key in GeoJSON features which is used
                as id to match the items included in the
                `locations` array. Only has an effect when
                `geojson` is set. Support nested property, for
                example "properties.name".
            geo
                Sets a reference between this trace's
                geospatial coordinates and a geographic map. If
                "geo" (the default value), the geospatial
                coordinates refer to `layout.geo`. If "geo2",
                the geospatial coordinates refer to
                `layout.geo2`, and so on.
            geojson
                Sets optional GeoJSON data associated with this
                trace. If not given, the features on the base
                map are used. It can be set as a valid GeoJSON
                object or as a URL string. Note that we only
                accept GeoJSONs of type "FeatureCollection" or
                "Feature" with geometries of type "Polygon" or
                "MultiPolygon".
            hoverinfo
                Determines which trace information appear on
                hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no
                information is displayed upon hovering. But, if
                `none` is set, click and hover events are still
                fired.
            hoverinfosrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `hoverinfo`.
            hoverlabel
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.Hoverla
                bel` instance or dict with compatible
                properties
            hovertemplate
                Template string used for rendering the
                information that appear on hover box. Note that
                this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are
                inserted using %{variable}, for example "y:
                %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
                {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for
                several points, "xother" will be added to those
                with different x positions from the first
                point. An underscore before or after
                "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
                only when this field is shown. Numbers are
                formatted using d3-format's syntax
                %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price:
                %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-
                format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the
                formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using
                d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-
                format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}".

                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on
                the date formatting syntax. The variables
                available in `hovertemplate` are the ones
                emitted as event data described at this link
                https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-
                events/#event-data. Additionally, every
                attributes that can be specified per-point (the
                ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.
                Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
                displayed in the secondary box, for example
                "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the
                secondary box completely, use an empty tag
                `<extra></extra>`.
            hovertemplatesrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `hovertemplate`.
            hovertext
                Same as `text`.
            hovertextsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `hovertext`.
            ids
                Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for
                object constancy of data points during
                animation. Should be an array of strings, not
                numbers or any other type.
            idssrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `ids`.
            legend
                Sets the reference to a legend to show this
                trace in. References to these legends are
                "legend", "legend2", "legend3", etc. Settings
                for these legends are set in the layout, under
                `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`, etc.
            legendgroup
                Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces
                and shapes part of the same legend group
                hide/show at the same time when toggling legend
                items.
            legendgrouptitle
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.Legendg
                rouptitle` instance or dict with compatible
                properties
            legendrank
                Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and
                groups with smaller ranks are presented on
                top/left side while with "reversed"
                `legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right
                side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that
                you can use ranks less than 1000 to place
                certain items before all unranked items, and
                ranks greater than 1000 to go after all
                unranked items. When having unranked or equal
                rank items shapes would be displayed after
                traces i.e. according to their order in data
                and layout.
            legendwidth
                Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the
                legend for this trace.
            locationmode
                Determines the set of locations used to match
                entries in `locations` to regions on the map.
                Values "ISO-3", "USA-states", *country names*
                correspond to features on the base map and
                value "geojson-id" corresponds to features from
                a custom GeoJSON linked to the `geojson`
                attribute.
            locations
                Sets the coordinates via location IDs or names.
                See `locationmode` for more info.
            locationssrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `locations`.
            marker
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.Marker`
                instance or dict with compatible properties
            meta
                Assigns extra meta information associated with
                this trace that can be used in various text
                attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`,
                graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`,
                annotation `text` `rangeselector`,
                `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all
                support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
                values in an attribute in the same trace,
                simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index
                or key of the `meta` item in question. To
                access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use
                `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or
                key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.
            metasrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `meta`.
            name
                Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as
                the legend item and on hover.
            reversescale
                Reverses the color mapping if true. If true,
                `zmin` will correspond to the last color in the
                array and `zmax` will correspond to the first
                color.
            selected
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.Selecte
                d` instance or dict with compatible properties
            selectedpoints
                Array containing integer indices of selected
                points. Has an effect only for traces that
                support selections. Note that an empty array
                means an empty selection where the `unselected`
                are turned on for all points, whereas, any
                other non-array values means no selection all
                where the `selected` and `unselected` styles
                have no effect.
            showlegend
                Determines whether or not an item corresponding
                to this trace is shown in the legend.
            showscale
                Determines whether or not a colorbar is
                displayed for this trace.
            stream
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.Stream`
                instance or dict with compatible properties
            text
                Sets the text elements associated with each
                location.
            textsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `text`.
            uid
                Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide
                object constancy between traces during
                animations and transitions.
            uirevision
                Controls persistence of some user-driven
                changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in
                `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable:
                true` modifications such as `name` and
                `colorbar.title`. Defaults to
                `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-
                driven trace attribute changes are controlled
                by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
                controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
                `selectedpoints` is controlled by
                `layout.selectionrevision`, and
                `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config:
                {editable: true}`) is controlled by
                `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
                tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on
                trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your
                app can add/remove traces before the end of the
                `data` array, such that the same trace has a
                different index, you can still preserve user-
                driven changes if you give each trace a `uid`
                that stays with it as it moves.
            unselected
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.choropleth.Unselec
                ted` instance or dict with compatible
                properties
            visible
                Determines whether or not this trace is
                visible. If "legendonly", the trace is not
                drawn, but can appear as a legend item
                (provided that the legend itself is visible).
            z
                Sets the color values.
            zauto
                Determines whether or not the color domain is
                computed with respect to the input data (here
                in `z`) or the bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`
                Defaults to `false` when `zmin` and `zmax` are
                set by the user.
            zmax
                Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value
                should have the same units as in `z` and if
                set, `zmin` must be set as well.
            zmid
                Sets the mid-point of the color domain by
                scaling `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant
                to this point. Value should have the same units
                as in `z`. Has no effect when `zauto` is
                `false`.
            zmin
                Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value
                should have the same units as in `z` and if
                set, `zmax` must be set as well.
            zsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `z`.
