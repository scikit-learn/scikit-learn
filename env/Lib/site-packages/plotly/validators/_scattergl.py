            connectgaps
                Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or
                missing values) in the provided data arrays are
                connected.
            customdata
                Assigns extra data each datum. This may be
                useful when listening to hover, click and
                selection events. Note that, "scatter" traces
                also appends customdata items in the markers
                DOM elements
            customdatasrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `customdata`.
            dx
                Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more
                info.
            dy
                Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more
                info.
            error_x
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.ErrorX`
                instance or dict with compatible properties
            error_y
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.ErrorY`
                instance or dict with compatible properties
            fill
                Sets the area to fill with a solid color.
                Defaults to "none" unless this trace is
                stacked, then it gets "tonexty" ("tonextx") if
                `orientation` is "v" ("h") Use with `fillcolor`
                if not "none". "tozerox" and "tozeroy" fill to
                x=0 and y=0 respectively. "tonextx" and
                "tonexty" fill between the endpoints of this
                trace and the endpoints of the trace before it,
                connecting those endpoints with straight lines
                (to make a stacked area graph); if there is no
                trace before it, they behave like "tozerox" and
                "tozeroy". "toself" connects the endpoints of
                the trace (or each segment of the trace if it
                has gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills
                the space between two traces if one completely
                encloses the other (eg consecutive contour
                lines), and behaves like "toself" if there is
                no trace before it. "tonext" should not be used
                if one trace does not enclose the other. Traces
                in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be
                filled to) other traces in the same group. With
                multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked
                and some not, if fill-linked traces are not
                already consecutive, the later ones will be
                pushed down in the drawing order.
            fillcolor
                Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-
                transparent variant of the line color, marker
                color, or marker line color, whichever is
                available.
            hoverinfo
                Determines which trace information appear on
                hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no
                information is displayed upon hovering. But, if
                `none` is set, click and hover events are still
                fired.
            hoverinfosrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `hoverinfo`.
            hoverlabel
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Hoverlab
                el` instance or dict with compatible properties
            hovertemplate
                Template string used for rendering the
                information that appear on hover box. Note that
                this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are
                inserted using %{variable}, for example "y:
                %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
                {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for
                several points, "xother" will be added to those
                with different x positions from the first
                point. An underscore before or after
                "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
                only when this field is shown. Numbers are
                formatted using d3-format's syntax
                %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price:
                %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-
                format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the
                formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using
                d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-
                format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}".
                https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on
                the date formatting syntax. The variables
                available in `hovertemplate` are the ones
                emitted as event data described at this link
                https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-
                events/#event-data. Additionally, every
                attributes that can be specified per-point (the
                ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.
                Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
                displayed in the secondary box, for example
                "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the
                secondary box completely, use an empty tag
                `<extra></extra>`.
            hovertemplatesrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `hovertemplate`.
            hovertext
                Sets hover text elements associated with each
                (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string
                appears over all the data points. If an array
                of string, the items are mapped in order to the
                this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen,
                trace `hoverinfo` must contain a "text" flag.
            hovertextsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `hovertext`.
            ids
                Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for
                object constancy of data points during
                animation. Should be an array of strings, not
                numbers or any other type.
            idssrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `ids`.
            legend
                Sets the reference to a legend to show this
                trace in. References to these legends are
                "legend", "legend2", "legend3", etc. Settings
                for these legends are set in the layout, under
                `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`, etc.
            legendgroup
                Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces
                and shapes part of the same legend group
                hide/show at the same time when toggling legend
                items.
            legendgrouptitle
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Legendgr
                ouptitle` instance or dict with compatible
                properties
            legendrank
                Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and
                groups with smaller ranks are presented on
                top/left side while with "reversed"
                `legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right
                side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that
                you can use ranks less than 1000 to place
                certain items before all unranked items, and
                ranks greater than 1000 to go after all
                unranked items. When having unranked or equal
                rank items shapes would be displayed after
                traces i.e. according to their order in data
                and layout.
            legendwidth
                Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the
                legend for this trace.

                instance or dict with compatible properties
            meta
                Assigns extra meta information associated with
                this trace that can be used in various text
                attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`,
                graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`,
                annotation `text` `rangeselector`,
                `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all
                support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
                values in an attribute in the same trace,
                simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index
                or key of the `meta` item in question. To
                access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use
                `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or
                key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.
            metasrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `meta`.
            mode
                Determines the drawing mode for this scatter
                trace.
            name
                Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as
                the legend item and on hover.
            opacity
                Sets the opacity of the trace.
            selected
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Selected
                ` instance or dict with compatible properties
            selectedpoints
                Array containing integer indices of selected
                points. Has an effect only for traces that
                support selections. Note that an empty array
                means an empty selection where the `unselected`
                are turned on for all points, whereas, any
                other non-array values means no selection all
                where the `selected` and `unselected` styles
                have no effect.
            showlegend
                Determines whether or not an item corresponding
                to this trace is shown in the legend.
            stream
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Stream`
                instance or dict with compatible properties
            text
                Sets text elements associated with each (x,y)
                pair. If a single string, the same string
                appears over all the data points. If an array
                of string, the items are mapped in order to the
                this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace
                `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
                "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be
                seen in the hover labels.
            textfont
                Sets the text font.
            textposition
                Sets the positions of the `text` elements with
                respects to the (x,y) coordinates.
            textpositionsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `textposition`.
            textsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `text`.
            texttemplate
                Template string used for rendering the
                information text that appear on points. Note
                that this will override `textinfo`. Variables
                are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y:
                %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's
                syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
                "Price: %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-
                format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the
                formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using
                d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-
                format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}".
                https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on
                the date formatting syntax. Every attributes
                that can be specified per-point (the ones that
                are `arrayOk: true`) are available.
            texttemplatesrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `texttemplate`.
            uid
                Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide
                object constancy between traces during
                animations and transitions.
            uirevision
                Controls persistence of some user-driven
                changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in
                `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable:
                true` modifications such as `name` and
                `colorbar.title`. Defaults to
                `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-
                driven trace attribute changes are controlled
                by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
                controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
                `selectedpoints` is controlled by
                `layout.selectionrevision`, and
                `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config:
                {editable: true}`) is controlled by
                `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
                tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on
                trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your
                app can add/remove traces before the end of the
                `data` array, such that the same trace has a
                different index, you can still preserve user-
                driven changes if you give each trace a `uid`
                that stays with it as it moves.
            unselected
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scattergl.Unselect
                ed` instance or dict with compatible properties
            visible
                Determines whether or not this trace is
                visible. If "legendonly", the trace is not
                drawn, but can appear as a legend item
                (provided that the legend itself is visible).
            x
                Sets the x coordinates.
            x0
                Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
                coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the
                starting coordinate and `dx` the step.
            xaxis
                Sets a reference between this trace's x
                coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x"
                (the default value), the x coordinates refer to
                `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x coordinates
                refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
            xcalendar
                Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date
                data.
            xhoverformat
                Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`
                using d3 formatting mini-languages which are
                very similar to those in Python. For numbers,
                see: https://github.com/d3/d3-
                format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates
                see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two
                items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of
                the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"
                for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display
                *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
                formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
            xperiod
                Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date".
                Sets the period positioning in milliseconds or
                "M<n>" on the x axis. Special values in the
                form of "M<n>" could be used to declare the
                number of months. In this case `n` must be a
                positive integer.
            xperiod0
                Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date".
                Sets the base for period positioning in
                milliseconds or date string on the x0 axis.
                When `x0period` is round number of weeks, the
                `x0period0` by default would be on a Sunday
                i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
                2000-01-01.
            xperiodalignment
                Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date".
                Sets the alignment of data points on the x
                axis.
            xsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `x`.
            y
                Sets the y coordinates.
            y0
                Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
                coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the
                starting coordinate and `dy` the step.
            yaxis
                Sets a reference between this trace's y
                coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y"
                (the default value), the y coordinates refer to
                `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y coordinates
                refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
            ycalendar
                Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date
                data.
            yhoverformat
                Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`
                using d3 formatting mini-languages which are
                very similar to those in Python. For numbers,
                see: https://github.com/d3/d3-
                format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates
                see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two
                items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of
                the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"
                for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display
                *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
                formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
            yperiod
                Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date".
                Sets the period positioning in milliseconds or
                "M<n>" on the y axis. Special values in the
                form of "M<n>" could be used to declare the
                number of months. In this case `n` must be a
                positive integer.
            yperiod0
                Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date".
                Sets the base for period positioning in
                milliseconds or date string on the y0 axis.
                When `y0period` is round number of weeks, the
                `y0period0` by default would be on a Sunday
                i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
                2000-01-01.
            yperiodalignment
                Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date".
                Sets the alignment of data points on the y
                axis.
            ysrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `y`.
