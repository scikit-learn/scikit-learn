            autorange
                Determines whether or not the range of this
                axis is computed in relation to the input data.
                See `rangemode` for more info. If `range` is
                provided and it has a value for both the lower
                and upper bound, `autorange` is set to False.
                Using "min" applies autorange only to set the
                minimum. Using "max" applies autorange only to
                set the maximum. Using *min reversed* applies
                autorange only to set the minimum on a reversed
                axis. Using *max reversed* applies autorange
                only to set the maximum on a reversed axis.
                Using "reversed" applies autorange on both ends
                and reverses the axis direction.
            autorangeoptions
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.scene.zaxis
                .Autorangeoptions` instance or dict with
                compatible properties
            autotypenumbers
                Using "strict" a numeric string in trace data
                is not converted to a number. Using *convert
                types* a numeric string in trace data may be
                treated as a number during automatic axis
                `type` detection. Defaults to
                layout.autotypenumbers.
            backgroundcolor
                Sets the background color of this axis' wall.
            calendar
                Sets the calendar system to use for `range` and
                `tick0` if this is a date axis. This does not
                set the calendar for interpreting data on this
                axis, that's specified in the trace or via the
                global `layout.calendar`
            categoryarray
                Sets the order in which categories on this axis
                appear. Only has an effect if `categoryorder`
                is set to "array". Used with `categoryorder`.
            categoryarraysrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `categoryarray`.
            categoryorder
                Specifies the ordering logic for the case of
                categorical variables. By default, plotly uses
                "trace", which specifies the order that is
                present in the data supplied. Set
                `categoryorder` to *category ascending* or
                *category descending* if order should be
                determined by the alphanumerical order of the
                category names. Set `categoryorder` to "array"
                to derive the ordering from the attribute
                `categoryarray`. If a category is not found in
                the `categoryarray` array, the sorting behavior
                for that attribute will be identical to the
                "trace" mode. The unspecified categories will
                follow the categories in `categoryarray`. Set
                `categoryorder` to *total ascending* or *total
                descending* if order should be determined by
                the numerical order of the values. Similarly,
                the order can be determined by the min, max,
                sum, mean, geometric mean or median of all the
                values.
            color
                Sets default for all colors associated with
                this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and
                grid colors. Grid color is lightened by
                blending this with the plot background
                Individual pieces can override this.
            dtick
                Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis.
                Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or
                special strings available to "log" and "date"
                axes. If the axis `type` is "log", then ticks
                are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick
                number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1,
                10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick
                marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To
                set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ...
                set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log"
                has several special values; "L<f>", where `f`
                is a positive number, gives ticks linearly
                spaced in value (but not position). For example
                `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks
                at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10
                plus small digits between, use "D1" (all
                digits) or "D2" (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is
                ignored for "D1" and "D2". If the axis `type`
                is "date", then you must convert the time to
                milliseconds. For example, to set the interval
                between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to
                86400000.0. "date" also has special values
                "M<n>" gives ticks spaced by a number of
                months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set
                ticks on the 15th of every third month, set
                `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To
                set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"
            exponentformat
                Determines a formatting rule for the tick
                exponents. For example, consider the number
                1,000,000,000. If "none", it appears as
                1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If "E", 1E+9. If
                "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If
                "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
            gridcolor
                Sets the color of the grid lines.
            gridwidth
                Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.
            hoverformat
                Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3
                formatting mini-languages which are very
                similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h
                ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-
                format. And for dates see:
                https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two
                items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of
                the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"
                for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display
                "09~15~23.46"
            labelalias
                Replacement text for specific tick or hover
                labels. For example using {US: 'USA', CA:
                'Canada'} changes US to USA and CA to Canada.
                The labels we would have shown must match the
                keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or
                ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign
                symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular
                ascii dash. That means you need to use âˆ’1
                instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any
                axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values
                (if desired) can include html-like tags or
                MathJax.
            linecolor
                Sets the axis line color.
            linewidth
                Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
            maxallowed
                Determines the maximum range of this axis.
            minallowed
                Determines the minimum range of this axis.
            minexponent
                Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this
                number. This only has an effect when
                `tickformat` is "SI" or "B".
            mirror
                Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are
                mirrored to the opposite side of the plotting
                area. If True, the axis lines are mirrored. If
                "ticks", the axis lines and ticks are mirrored.
                If False, mirroring is disable. If "all", axis
                lines are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.
                If "allticks", axis lines and ticks are
                mirrored on all shared-axes subplots.
            nticks
                Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
                particular axis. The actual number of ticks
                will be chosen automatically to be less than or
                equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if
                `tickmode` is set to "auto".
            range
                Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type`
                is "log", then you must take the log of your
                desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to
                100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis
                `type` is "date", it should be date strings,
                like date data, though Date objects and unix
                milliseconds will be accepted and converted to
                strings. If the axis `type` is "category", it
                should be numbers, using the scale where each
                category is assigned a serial number from zero
                in the order it appears. Leaving either or both
                elements `null` impacts the default
                `autorange`.
            rangemode
                If "normal", the range is computed in relation
                to the extrema of the input data. If *tozero*`,
                the range extends to 0, regardless of the input
                data If "nonnegative", the range is non-
                negative, regardless of the input data. Applies
                only to linear axes.
            separatethousands
                If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
            showaxeslabels
                Sets whether or not this axis is labeled
            showbackground
                Sets whether or not this axis' wall has a
                background color.
            showexponent
                If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
                significands. If "first", only the exponent of
                the first tick is shown. If "last", only the
                exponent of the last tick is shown. If "none",
                no exponents appear.
            showgrid
                Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn.
                If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick
                mark.
            showline
                Determines whether or not a line bounding this
                axis is drawn.
            showspikes
                Sets whether or not spikes starting from data
                points to this axis' wall are shown on hover.
            showticklabels
                Determines whether or not the tick labels are
                drawn.
            showtickprefix
                If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a
                prefix. If "first", only the first tick is
                displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the
                last tick is displayed with a suffix. If
                "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
            showticksuffix
                Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
            spikecolor
                Sets the color of the spikes.
            spikesides
                Sets whether or not spikes extending from the
                projection data points to this axis' wall
                boundaries are shown on hover.
            spikethickness
                Sets the thickness (in px) of the spikes.
            tick0
                Sets the placement of the first tick on this
                axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is
                "log", then you must take the log of your
                starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to
                100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when
                `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If
                the axis `type` is "date", it should be a date
                string, like date data. If the axis `type` is
                "category", it should be a number, using the
                scale where each category is assigned a serial
                number from zero in the order it appears.
            tickangle
                Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect
                to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle`
                of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.
            tickcolor
                Sets the tick color.
            tickfont
                Sets the tick font.
            tickformat
                Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3
                formatting mini-languages which are very
                similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h
                ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-
                format. And for dates see:
                https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two
                items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of
                the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"
                for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display
                "09~15~23.46"
            tickformatstops
                A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.
                scene.zaxis.Tickformatstop` instances or dicts
                with compatible properties
            tickformatstopdefaults
                When used in a template (as layout.template.lay
                out.scene.zaxis.tickformatstopdefaults), sets
                the default property values to use for elements
                of layout.scene.zaxis.tickformatstops
            ticklen
                Sets the tick length (in px).
            tickmode
                Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto",
                the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If
                "linear", the placement of the ticks is
                determined by a starting position `tick0` and a
                tick step `dtick` ("linear" is the default
                value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If
                "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
                `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`.
                ("array" is the default value if `tickvals` is
                provided).
            tickprefix
                Sets a tick label prefix.
            ticks
                Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If
                "", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If
                "outside" ("inside"), this axis' are drawn
                outside (inside) the axis lines.
            ticksuffix
                Sets a tick label suffix.
            ticktext
                Sets the text displayed at the ticks position
                via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if
                `tickmode` is set to "array". Used with
                `tickvals`.
            ticktextsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `ticktext`.
            tickvals
                Sets the values at which ticks on this axis
                appear. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set
                to "array". Used with `ticktext`.
            tickvalssrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `tickvals`.
            tickwidth
                Sets the tick width (in px).
            title
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.scene.zaxis
