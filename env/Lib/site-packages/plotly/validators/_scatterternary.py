                they need not be normalized, only the relative

            c
                Sets the quantity of component `a` in each data

                `ternary<i>.sum`.
            cliponaxis
                Determines whether or not markers and text
                nodes are clipped about the subplot axes. To
                show markers and text nodes above axis lines
                and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer`
                and `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
            connectgaps
                Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or
                missing values) in the provided data arrays are
                connected.
            csrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `c`.
            customdata
                Assigns extra data each datum. This may be
                useful when listening to hover, click and
                selection events. Note that, "scatter" traces
                also appends customdata items in the markers
                DOM elements
            customdatasrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `customdata`.
            fill
                Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use
                with `fillcolor` if not "none". scatterternary
                has a subset of the options available to
                scatter. "toself" connects the endpoints of the
                trace (or each segment of the trace if it has
                gaps) into a closed shape. "tonext" fills the
                space between two traces if one completely
                encloses the other (eg consecutive contour
                lines), and behaves like "toself" if there is
                no trace before it. "tonext" should not be used
                if one trace does not enclose the other.
            fillcolor
                Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-
                transparent variant of the line color, marker
                color, or marker line color, whichever is
                available.
            hoverinfo
                Determines which trace information appear on
                hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no
                information is displayed upon hovering. But, if
                `none` is set, click and hover events are still
                fired.
            hoverinfosrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `hoverinfo`.
            hoverlabel
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterternary.Hov
                erlabel` instance or dict with compatible
                properties
            hoveron
                Do the hover effects highlight individual
                points (markers or line points) or do they
                highlight filled regions? If the fill is
                "toself" or "tonext" and there are no markers
                or text, then the default is "fills", otherwise
                it is "points".
            hovertemplate
                Template string used for rendering the
                information that appear on hover box. Note that
                this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are
                inserted using %{variable}, for example "y:
                %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
                {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for
                several points, "xother" will be added to those
                with different x positions from the first
                point. An underscore before or after
                "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
                only when this field is shown. Numbers are
                formatted using d3-format's syntax
                %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price:
                %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-
                format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the
                formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using
                d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-
                format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}".
                https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on
                the date formatting syntax. The variables
                available in `hovertemplate` are the ones
                emitted as event data described at this link
                https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-
                events/#event-data. Additionally, every
                attributes that can be specified per-point (the
                ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.
                Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
                displayed in the secondary box, for example
                "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the
                secondary box completely, use an empty tag
                `<extra></extra>`.
            hovertemplatesrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `hovertemplate`.
            hovertext
                Sets hover text elements associated with each
                (a,b,c) point. If a single string, the same
                string appears over all the data points. If an
                array of strings, the items are mapped in order
                to the the data points in (a,b,c). To be seen,
                trace `hoverinfo` must contain a "text" flag.
            hovertextsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `hovertext`.
            ids
                Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for
                object constancy of data points during
                animation. Should be an array of strings, not
                numbers or any other type.
            idssrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `ids`.
            legend
                Sets the reference to a legend to show this
                trace in. References to these legends are
                "legend", "legend2", "legend3", etc. Settings
                for these legends are set in the layout, under
                `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`, etc.
            legendgroup
                Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces
                and shapes part of the same legend group
                hide/show at the same time when toggling legend
                items.
            legendgrouptitle
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatterternary.Leg
                endgrouptitle` instance or dict with compatible
                properties
            legendrank
                Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and
                groups with smaller ranks are presented on
                top/left side while with "reversed"
                `legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right
                side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that
                you can use ranks less than 1000 to place
                certain items before all unranked items, and
                ranks greater than 1000 to go after all
                unranked items. When having unranked or equal
                rank items shapes would be displayed after
                traces i.e. according to their order in data
                and layout.
            legendwidth
                Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the
                legend for this trace.

            meta
                Assigns extra meta information associated with
                this trace that can be used in various text
                attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`,
                graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`,
                annotation `text` `rangeselector`,
                `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all
                support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
                values in an attribute in the same trace,
                simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index
                or key of the `meta` item in question. To
                access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use
                `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or
                key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.
            metasrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `meta`.
            mode
                Determines the drawing mode for this scatter
                trace. If the provided `mode` includes "text"
                then the `text` elements appear at the
                coordinates. Otherwise, the `text` elements
                appear on hover. If there are less than 20
                points and the trace is not stacked then the
                default is "lines+markers". Otherwise, "lines".
            name
                Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as
                the legend item and on hover.
            opacity
                Sets the opacity of the trace.

            selectedpoints
                Array containing integer indices of selected
                points. Has an effect only for traces that
                support selections. Note that an empty array
                means an empty selection where the `unselected`
                are turned on for all points, whereas, any
                other non-array values means no selection all
                where the `selected` and `unselected` styles
                have no effect.
            showlegend
                Determines whether or not an item corresponding
                to this trace is shown in the legend.

            subplot
                Sets a reference between this trace's data
                coordinates and a ternary subplot. If "ternary"
                (the default value), the data refer to
                `layout.ternary`. If "ternary2", the data refer
                to `layout.ternary2`, and so on.
            sum
                The number each triplet should sum to, if only
                two of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided. This
                overrides `ternary<i>.sum` to normalize this
                specific trace, but does not affect the values
                displayed on the axes. 0 (or missing) means to
                use ternary<i>.sum
            text
                Sets text elements associated with each (a,b,c)
                point. If a single string, the same string
                appears over all the data points. If an array
                of strings, the items are mapped in order to
                the the data points in (a,b,c). If trace
                `hoverinfo` contains a "text" flag and
                "hovertext" is not set, these elements will be
                seen in the hover labels.
            textfont
                Sets the text font.
            textposition
                Sets the positions of the `text` elements with
                respects to the (x,y) coordinates.
            textpositionsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `textposition`.
            textsrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `text`.
            texttemplate
                Template string used for rendering the
                information text that appear on points. Note
                that this will override `textinfo`. Variables
                are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y:
                %{y}". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's
                syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
                "Price: %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-
                format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the
                formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using
                d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-
                format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}".
                https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on
                the date formatting syntax. Every attributes
                that can be specified per-point (the ones that
                are `arrayOk: true`) are available. Finally,
                the template string has access to variables
                `a`, `b`, `c` and `text`.
            texttemplatesrc
                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                for `texttemplate`.
            uid
                Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide
                object constancy between traces during
                animations and transitions.
            uirevision
                Controls persistence of some user-driven
                changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in
                `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable:
                true` modifications such as `name` and
                `colorbar.title`. Defaults to
                `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-
                driven trace attribute changes are controlled
                by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
                controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
                `selectedpoints` is controlled by
                `layout.selectionrevision`, and
                `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config:
                {editable: true}`) is controlled by
                `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
                tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on
                trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your
                app can add/remove traces before the end of the
                `data` array, such that the same trace has a
                different index, you can still preserve user-
                driven changes if you give each trace a `uid`
                that stays with it as it moves.

                drawn, but can appear as a legend item
                (provided that the legend itself is visible).
