                    Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if
                    colors is set to a numerical array. The
                    colorscale must be an array containing arrays
                    mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba,
                    hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At
                    minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and
                    highest (1) values are required. For example,

                    Sets the maximum rounding of corners (in px).
                depthfade
                    Determines if the sector colors are faded
                    towards the background from the leaves up to
                    the headers. This option is unavailable when a
                    `colorscale` is present, defaults to false when
                    `marker.colors` is set, but otherwise defaults
                    to true. When set to "reversed", the fading
                    direction is inverted, that is the top elements
                    within hierarchy are drawn with fully saturated

            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        level

        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.

            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        outsidetextfont
            Sets the font used for `textinfo` lying outside the
            sector. This option refers to the root of the hierarchy
            presented on top left corner of a treemap graph. Please
            note that if a hierarchy has multiple root nodes, this
            option won't have any effect and `insidetextfont` would
            be used.
        parents
            Sets the parent sectors for each of the sectors. Empty
            string items '' are understood to reference the root
            node in the hierarchy. If `ids` is filled, `parents`
            items are understood to be "ids" themselves. When `ids`
            is not set, plotly attempts to find matching items in
            `labels`, but beware they must be unique.
        parentssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `parents`.

            trace `textinfo` contains a "text" flag, these elements
            will be seen on the chart. If trace `hoverinfo`
            contains a "text" flag and "hovertext" is not set,
            these elements will be seen in the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the font used for `textinfo`.
        textinfo

            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,

            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.treemap.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `currentPath`, `root`, `entry`,
            `percentRoot`, `percentEntry` and `percentParent`.
            Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the
            secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each sector.
            If a single string, the same string appears for all
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order of this trace's sectors. To be seen,
            trace `hoverinfo` must contain a "text" flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        insidetextfont
            Sets the font used for `textinfo` lying inside the
            sector.
        labels
            Sets the labels of each of the sectors.
        labelssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `labels`.
        legend
            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.
            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",
            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in
            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,
            etc.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.treemap.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        level
            Sets the level from which this trace hierarchy is
            rendered. Set `level` to `''` to start from the root
            node in the hierarchy. Must be an "id" if `ids` is
            filled in, otherwise plotly attempts to find a matching
            item in `labels`.
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.treemap.Marker` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        maxdepth
            Sets the number of rendered sectors from any given
            `level`. Set `maxdepth` to "-1" to render all the
            levels in the hierarchy.
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        outsidetextfont
            Sets the font used for `textinfo` lying outside the
            sector. This option refers to the root of the hierarchy
            presented on top left corner of a treemap graph. Please
            note that if a hierarchy has multiple root nodes, this
            option won't have any effect and `insidetextfont` would
            be used.
        parents
            Sets the parent sectors for each of the sectors. Empty
            string items '' are understood to reference the root
            node in the hierarchy. If `ids` is filled, `parents`
            items are understood to be "ids" themselves. When `ids`
            is not set, plotly attempts to find matching items in
            `labels`, but beware they must be unique.
        parentssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `parents`.
        pathbar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.treemap.Pathbar` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        root
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.treemap.Root` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        sort
            Determines whether or not the sectors are reordered
            from largest to smallest.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.treemap.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each sector. If
            trace `textinfo` contains a "text" flag, these elements
            will be seen on the chart. If trace `hoverinfo`
            contains a "text" flag and "hovertext" is not set,
            these elements will be seen in the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the font used for `textinfo`.
        textinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on the graph.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `currentPath`, `root`, `entry`,
            `percentRoot`, `percentEntry`, `percentParent`, `label`
            and `value`.
        texttemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `texttemplate`.
        tiling
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.treemap.Tiling` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        values
            Sets the values associated with each of the sectors.
            Use with `branchvalues` to determine how the values are
            summed.
        valuessrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `values`.
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
