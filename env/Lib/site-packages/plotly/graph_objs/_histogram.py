                    only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical
                    array. Value should have the same units as in
                    `marker.color`. Has no effect when
                    `marker.cauto` is `false`.
                cmin
                    Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has
                    an effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a
                    numerical array. Value should have the same

                    `marker.cmax` must be set as well.
                color
                    Sets the marker color. It accepts either a
                    specific color or an array of numbers that are
                    mapped to the colorscale relative to the max
                    and min values of the array or relative to
                    `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax` if set.
                coloraxis
                    Sets a reference to a shared color axis.
                    References to these shared color axes are
                    "coloraxis", "coloraxis2", "coloraxis3", etc.
                    Settings for these shared color axes are set in
                    the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
                    `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple
                    color scales can be linked to the same color
                    axis.

                    properties
                colorscale
                    Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in
                    `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. The
                    colorscale must be an array containing arrays
                    mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba,
                    hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At
                    minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and
                    highest (1) values are required. For example,
                    `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`.
                    To control the bounds of the colorscale in
                    color space, use `marker.cmin` and
                    `marker.cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may
                    be a palette name string of the following list:
                    Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,
                    Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,Rd

                    Sets the rounding of corners. May be an integer
                    number of pixels, or a percentage of bar width
                    (as a string ending in %). Defaults to
                    `layout.barcornerradius`. In stack or relative

                reversescale
                    Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an
                    effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a
                    numerical array. If true, `marker.cmin` will
                    correspond to the last color in the array and
                    `marker.cmax` will correspond to the first
                    color.
                showscale
                    Determines whether or not a colorbar is
                    displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if
                    in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array.

          - An instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.histogram.Textfont`
          - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
            to the Textfont constructor

            Supported dict properties:

                color

                family
                    HTML font family - the typeface that will be
                    applied by the web browser. The web browser
                    will only be able to apply a font if it is
                    available on the system which it operates.
                    Provide multiple font families, separated by
                    commas, to indicate the preference in which to
                    apply fonts if they aren't available on the
                    system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at
                    https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise)
                    generates images on a server, where only a
                    select number of fonts are installed and
                    supported. These include "Arial", "Balto",
                    "Courier New", "Droid Sans", "Droid Serif",
                    "Droid Sans Mono", "Gravitas One", "Old
                    Standard TT", "Open Sans", "Overpass", "PT Sans
                    Narrow", "Raleway", "Times New Roman".
                lineposition
                    Sets the kind of decoration line(s) with text,
                    such as an "under", "over" or "through" as well
                    as combinations e.g. "under+over", etc.
                shadow
                    Sets the shape and color of the shadow behind
                    text. "auto" places minimal shadow and applies
                    contrast text font color. See
                    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
                    US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow for additional
                    options.
                size

                style
                    Sets whether a font should be styled with a
                    normal or italic face from its family.
                textcase
                    Sets capitalization of text. It can be used to
                    make text appear in all-uppercase or all-
                    lowercase, or with each word capitalized.
                variant
                    Sets the variant of the font.
                weight
                    Sets the weight (or boldness) of the font.

                    a date string, and for category data `end` is
                    based on the category serial numbers.
                size
                    Sets the size of each x axis bin. Default
                    behavior: If `nbinsx` is 0 or omitted, we
                    choose a nice round bin size such that the
                    number of bins is about the same as the typical
                    number of samples in each bin. If `nbinsx` is
                    provided, we choose a nice round bin size
                    giving no more than that many bins. For date
                    data, use milliseconds or "M<n>" for months, as
                    in `axis.dtick`. For category data, the number
                    of categories to bin together (always defaults
                    to 1). If multiple non-overlaying histograms
                    share a subplot, the first explicit `size` is
                    used and all others discarded. If no `size` is
                    provided,the sample data from all traces is
                    combined to determine `size` as described
                    above.
                start
                    Sets the starting value for the x axis bins.
                    Defaults to the minimum data value, shifted
                    down if necessary to make nice round values and
                    to remove ambiguous bin edges. For example, if
                    most of the data is integers we shift the bin
                    edges 0.5 down, so a `size` of 5 would have a
                    default `start` of -0.5, so it is clear that
                    0-4 are in the first bin, 5-9 in the second,
                    but continuous data gets a start of 0 and bins
                    [0,5), [5,10) etc. Dates behave similarly, and
                    `start` should be a date string. For category
                    data, `start` is based on the category serial
                    numbers, and defaults to -0.5. If multiple non-
                    overlaying histograms share a subplot, the
                    first explicit `start` is used exactly and all
                    others are shifted down (if necessary) to
                    differ from that one by an integer number of

                    choose a nice round bin size such that the
                    number of bins is about the same as the typical
                    number of samples in each bin. If `nbinsy` is
                    provided, we choose a nice round bin size
                    giving no more than that many bins. For date
                    data, use milliseconds or "M<n>" for months, as
                    in `axis.dtick`. For category data, the number
                    of categories to bin together (always defaults
                    to 1). If multiple non-overlaying histograms
                    share a subplot, the first explicit `size` is
                    used and all others discarded. If no `size` is
                    provided,the sample data from all traces is
                    combined to determine `size` as described
                    above.
                start
                    Sets the starting value for the y axis bins.
                    Defaults to the minimum data value, shifted
                    down if necessary to make nice round values and
                    to remove ambiguous bin edges. For example, if
                    most of the data is integers we shift the bin
                    edges 0.5 down, so a `size` of 5 would have a
                    default `start` of -0.5, so it is clear that
                    0-4 are in the first bin, 5-9 in the second,
                    but continuous data gets a start of 0 and bins
                    [0,5), [5,10) etc. Dates behave similarly, and
                    `start` should be a date string. For category
                    data, `start` is based on the category serial
                    numbers, and defaults to -0.5. If multiple non-
                    overlaying histograms share a subplot, the
                    first explicit `start` is used exactly and all
                    others are shifted down (if necessary) to
                    differ from that one by an integer number of
                    bins.

            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted

            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.

            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc

            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets hover text elements associated with each bar. If a
            single string, the same string appears over all bars.
            If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to
            the this trace's coordinates.
        textangle
            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may
            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
            in bars.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Specifies the location of the `text`. "inside"
            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
            and scaled if needed). "outside" positions `text`
            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`
            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If
            "none", no text appears.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".

            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `label` and `value`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

        Construct a new Histogram object

        The sample data from which statistics are computed is set in
        `x` for vertically spanning histograms and in `y` for
        horizontally spanning histograms. Binning options are set
        `xbins` and `ybins` respectively if no aggregation data is
        provided.

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg
            dict of properties compatible with this constructor or
            an instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.Histogram`
        alignmentgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
            whether bars compute their positional range dependently
            or independently.
        autobinx
            Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
            determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
            However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
            update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
            from the trace.
        autobiny
            Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
            determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
            However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
            update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
            from the trace.
        bingroup
            Set a group of histogram traces which will have
            compatible bin settings. Note that traces on the same
            subplot and with the same "orientation" under `barmode`
            "stack", "relative" and "group" are forced into the
            same bingroup, Using `bingroup`, traces under `barmode`
            "overlay" and on different axes (of the same axis type)
            can have compatible bin settings. Note that histogram
            and histogram2d* trace can share the same `bingroup`
        cliponaxis
            Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
            subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
            and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
            `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
        constraintext
            Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to
            be no larger than the bar itself.
        cumulative
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Cumulative`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `customdata`.
        error_x
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.ErrorX` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        error_y
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.ErrorY` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        histfunc
            Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
            trace. If "count", the histogram values are computed by
            counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
            "sum", "avg", "min", "max", the histogram values are
            computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
            maximum of the values lying inside each bin
            respectively.
        histnorm
            Specifies the type of normalization used for this
            histogram trace. If "", the span of each bar
            corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
            number of data points lying inside the bins). If
            "percent" / "probability", the span of each bar
            corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
            with respect to the total number of sample points
            (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
            "density", the span of each bar corresponds to the
            number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
            the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
            the total number of sample points). If *probability
            density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
            probability that an event will fall into the
            corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
            equals 1).
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".

            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variable `binNumber` Anything contained in tag
            `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for
            example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the
            secondary box completely, use an empty tag
            `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.

            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.

            points in `textposition` "inside" mode.
        insidetextfont
            Sets the font used for `text` lying inside the bar.
        legend
            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.
            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",
            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in
            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,
            etc.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes
            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same
            time when toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Legendgrouptitle
            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        marker
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Marker` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.

            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover.
        nbinsx
            Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
            value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
            optimal bin size such that the histogram best

            `xbins.size` is provided.
        nbinsy
            Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
            value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
            optimal bin size such that the histogram best
            visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
            `ybins.size` is provided.
        offsetgroup
            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
            same position coordinate will line up.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation

            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets hover text elements associated with each bar. If a
            single string, the same string appears over all bars.
            If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to
            the this trace's coordinates.
        textangle
            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
            labels vertically. With "auto" the texts may
            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
            in bars.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Specifies the location of the `text`. "inside"
            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
            and scaled if needed). "outside" positions `text`
            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
            gets pushed inside. "auto" tries to position `text`
            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If
            "none", no text appears.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `label` and `value`.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.Unselected`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the sample data to be binned on the x axis.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xbins
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.XBins` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            Sets the sample data to be binned on the y axis.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ybins
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.YBins` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.

            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.
        zorder
            Sets the layer on which this trace is displayed,
            relative to other SVG traces on the same subplot. SVG
            traces with higher `zorder` appear in front of those
            with lower `zorder`.
