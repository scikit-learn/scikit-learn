        The 'colorbar' property is an instance of ColorBar
        that may be specified as:
          - An instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.heatmap.ColorBar`
          - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
            to the ColorBar constructor

            Supported dict properties:

                bgcolor
                    Sets the color of padded area.
                bordercolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                borderwidth
                    Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing
                    this color bar.
                dtick
                    Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis.
                    Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or
                    special strings available to "log" and "date"
                    axes. If the axis `type` is "log", then ticks
                    are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick
                    number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1,
                    10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick
                    marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To
                    set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ...
                    set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log"
                    has several special values; "L<f>", where `f`
                    is a positive number, gives ticks linearly
                    spaced in value (but not position). For example
                    `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks
                    at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10
                    plus small digits between, use "D1" (all
                    digits) or "D2" (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is
                    ignored for "D1" and "D2". If the axis `type`
                    is "date", then you must convert the time to
                    milliseconds. For example, to set the interval
                    between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to
                    86400000.0. "date" also has special values
                    "M<n>" gives ticks spaced by a number of
                    months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set
                    ticks on the 15th of every third month, set
                    `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To
                    set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"
                exponentformat
                    Determines a formatting rule for the tick
                    exponents. For example, consider the number
                    1,000,000,000. If "none", it appears as
                    1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If "E", 1E+9. If
                    "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If
                    "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
                labelalias
                    Replacement text for specific tick or hover
                    labels. For example using {US: 'USA', CA:
                    'Canada'} changes US to USA and CA to Canada.
                    The labels we would have shown must match the
                    keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or
                    ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign
                    symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular
                    ascii dash. That means you need to use −1
                    instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any
                    axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values
                    (if desired) can include html-like tags or
                    MathJax.
                len
                    Sets the length of the color bar This measure
                    excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the
                    color bar length is this length minus the
                    padding on both ends.
                lenmode
                    Determines whether this color bar's length
                    (i.e. the measure in the color variation
                    direction) is set in units of plot "fraction"
                    or in *pixels. Use `len` to set the value.
                minexponent
                    Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this
                    number. This only has an effect when
                    `tickformat` is "SI" or "B".
                nticks
                    Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
                    particular axis. The actual number of ticks
                    will be chosen automatically to be less than or
                    equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if
                    `tickmode` is set to "auto".
                orientation
                    Sets the orientation of the colorbar.
                outlinecolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                outlinewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
                separatethousands
                    If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
                showexponent
                    If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
                    significands. If "first", only the exponent of
                    the first tick is shown. If "last", only the
                    exponent of the last tick is shown. If "none",
                    no exponents appear.
                showticklabels
                    Determines whether or not the tick labels are
                    drawn.
                showtickprefix
                    If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a
                    prefix. If "first", only the first tick is
                    displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the
                    last tick is displayed with a suffix. If
                    "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
                showticksuffix
                    Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
                thickness
                    Sets the thickness of the color bar This
                    measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks
                    and labels.
                thicknessmode
                    Determines whether this color bar's thickness
                    (i.e. the measure in the constant color
                    direction) is set in units of plot "fraction"
                    or in "pixels". Use `thickness` to set the
                    value.
                tick0
                    Sets the placement of the first tick on this
                    axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is
                    "log", then you must take the log of your
                    starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to
                    100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when
                    `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If
                    the axis `type` is "date", it should be a date
                    string, like date data. If the axis `type` is
                    "category", it should be a number, using the
                    scale where each category is assigned a serial
                    number from zero in the order it appears.
                tickangle
                    Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect
                    to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle`
                    of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.
                tickcolor
                    Sets the tick color.
                tickfont
                    Sets the color bar's tick label font
                tickformat
                    Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3
                    formatting mini-languages which are very
                    similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h
                    ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-
                    format. And for dates see:
                    https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                    format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two
                    items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of
                    the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"
                    for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                    example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                    tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display
                    "09~15~23.46"
                tickformatstops
                    A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap
                    .colorbar.Tickformatstop` instances or dicts
                    with compatible properties
                tickformatstopdefaults
                    When used in a template (as layout.template.dat
                    a.heatmap.colorbar.tickformatstopdefaults),
                    sets the default property values to use for
                    elements of heatmap.colorbar.tickformatstops
                ticklabeloverflow
                    Determines how we handle tick labels that would
                    overflow either the graph div or the domain of
                    the axis. The default value for inside tick
                    labels is *hide past domain*. In other cases
                    the default is *hide past div*.
                ticklabelposition
                    Determines where tick labels are drawn relative
                    to the ticks. Left and right options are used
                    when `orientation` is "h", top and bottom when
                    `orientation` is "v".
                ticklabelstep
                    Sets the spacing between tick labels as
                    compared to the spacing between ticks. A value
                    of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A
                    value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A
                    larger value n means only every nth tick is
                    labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are
                    shown. Not implemented for axes with `type`
                    "log" or "multicategory", or when `tickmode` is
                    "array".
                ticklen
                    Sets the tick length (in px).
                tickmode
                    Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto",
                    the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If
                    "linear", the placement of the ticks is
                    determined by a starting position `tick0` and a
                    tick step `dtick` ("linear" is the default
                    value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If
                    "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
                    `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`.
                    ("array" is the default value if `tickvals` is
                    provided).
                tickprefix
                    Sets a tick label prefix.
                ticks
                    Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If
                    "", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If
                    "outside" ("inside"), this axis' are drawn
                    outside (inside) the axis lines.
                ticksuffix
                    Sets a tick label suffix.
                ticktext
                    Sets the text displayed at the ticks position
                    via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if
                    `tickmode` is set to "array". Used with
                    `tickvals`.
                ticktextsrc
                    Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                    for `ticktext`.
                tickvals
                    Sets the values at which ticks on this axis
                    appear. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set
                    to "array". Used with `ticktext`.

        colorbar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.ColorBar` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        colorscale
            Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
            containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
            rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
            a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
            required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1,
            'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the
            colorscale in color space, use `zmin` and `zmax`.
            Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
            string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,C
            ividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portl
            and,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd.
        connectgaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the `z` data are filled in. It is defaulted
            to true if `z` is a one dimensional array and `zsmooth`
            is not false; otherwise it is defaulted to false.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `customdata`.

            Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hoverongaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the `z` data have hover labels associated
            with them.
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Same as `text`.

            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legend
            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.
            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",
            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in
            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,
            etc.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes
            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same
            time when toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.

            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        reversescale
            Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
            will correspond to the last color in the array and
            `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        showscale
            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
            this trace.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
        textfont

        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `x`, `y`, `z` and `text`.
        transpose
            Transposes the z data.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xgap
            Sets the horizontal gap (in pixels) between bricks.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        xtype
            If "array", the heatmap's x coordinates are given by
            "x" (the default behavior when `x` is provided). If
            "scaled", the heatmap's x coordinates are given by "x0"
            and "dx" (the default behavior when `x` is not
            provided).
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        ygap
            Sets the vertical gap (in pixels) between bricks.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the

            "scaled", the heatmap's y coordinates are given by "y0"
            and "dy" (the default behavior when `y` is not
            provided)
        z
            Sets the z data.
        zauto
            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
            with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
            bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax` Defaults to `false`
            when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
        zhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `z`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d
            3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.By default the values
            are formatted using generic number format.
        zmax
            Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
            be set as well.
        zmid
            Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
            `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.
            Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no
            effect when `zauto` is `false`.
        zmin
            Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must
            be set as well.
        zorder
            Sets the layer on which this trace is displayed,
            relative to other SVG traces on the same subplot. SVG
            traces with higher `zorder` appear in front of those
            with lower `zorder`.
        zsmooth
            Picks a smoothing algorithm use to smooth `z` data.
        zsrc

        Construct a new Heatmap object

        The data that describes the heatmap value-to-color mapping is
        set in `z`. Data in `z` can either be a 2D list of values
        (ragged or not) or a 1D array of values. In the case where `z`
        is a 2D list, say that `z` has N rows and M columns. Then, by
        default, the resulting heatmap will have N partitions along the
        y axis and M partitions along the x axis. In other words, the
        i-th row/ j-th column cell in `z` is mapped to the i-th
        partition of the y axis (starting from the bottom of the plot)
        and the j-th partition of the x-axis (starting from the left of
        the plot). This behavior can be flipped by using `transpose`.
        Moreover, `x` (`y`) can be provided with M or M+1 (N or N+1)
        elements. If M (N), then the coordinates correspond to the
        center of the heatmap cells and the cells have equal width. If
        M+1 (N+1), then the coordinates correspond to the edges of the
        heatmap cells. In the case where `z` is a 1D list, the x and y
        coordinates must be provided in `x` and `y` respectively to
        form data triplets.

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg
            dict of properties compatible with this constructor or
            an instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.Heatmap`
        autocolorscale
            Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
            (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
            `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
            `autocolorscale` is true, the default palette will be
            chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
            array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
        coloraxis
            Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
            these shared color axes are "coloraxis", "coloraxis2",
            "coloraxis3", etc. Settings for these shared color axes
            are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
            `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
            scales can be linked to the same color axis.
        colorbar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.ColorBar` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        colorscale
            Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
            containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
            rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
            a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
            required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1,
            'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the
            colorscale in color space, use `zmin` and `zmax`.
            Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
            string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,C
            ividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portl
            and,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd.
        connectgaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the `z` data are filled in. It is defaulted
            to true if `z` is a one dimensional array and `zsmooth`
            is not false; otherwise it is defaulted to false.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, "scatter" traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `customdata`.
        dx
            Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
        dy
            Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hoverinfo`.
        hoverlabel
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.Hoverlabel`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        hoverongaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the `z` data have hover labels associated
            with them.
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother},
            {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several
            points, "xother" will be added to those with different
            x positions from the first point. An underscore before
            or after "(x|y)other" will add a space on that side,
            only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted
            using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for
            example "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-
            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertemplate`.
        hovertext
            Same as `text`.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `hovertext`.
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `ids`.
        legend
            Sets the reference to a legend to show this trace in.
            References to these legends are "legend", "legend2",
            "legend3", etc. Settings for these legends are set in
            the layout, under `layout.legend`, `layout.legend2`,
            etc.
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces and shapes
            part of the same legend group hide/show at the same
            time when toggling legend items.
        legendgrouptitle
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.Legendgrouptitle`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        legendrank
            Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups
            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while
            with "reversed" `legend.traceorder` they are on
            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so
            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain
            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than
            1000 to go after all unranked items. When having
            unranked or equal rank items shapes would be displayed
            after traces i.e. according to their order in data and
            layout.
        legendwidth
            Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for
            this trace.
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `meta`.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        reversescale
            Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
            will correspond to the last color in the array and
            `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        showscale
            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
            this trace.
        stream
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.heatmap.Stream` instance
            or dict with compatible properties
        text
            Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `text`.
        texttemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information text
            that appear on points. Note that this will override
            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example "y: %{y}". Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            "Price: %{y:$.2f}".
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format
            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are
            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax
            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day:
            %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the
            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be
            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)
            are available. Finally, the template string has access
            to variables `x`, `y`, `z` and `text`.
        transpose
            Transposes the z data.
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xgap
            Sets the horizontal gap (in pixels) between bricks.
        xhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
        xperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the x
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        xperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        xperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the x axis.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        xtype
            If "array", the heatmap's x coordinates are given by
            "x" (the default behavior when `x` is provided). If
            "scaled", the heatmap's x coordinates are given by "x0"
            and "dx" (the default behavior when `x` is not
            provided).
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        ygap
            Sets the vertical gap (in pixels) between bricks.
        yhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `y`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see:
            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.
            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to
            d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of the year as a
            decimal number as well as "%{n}f" for fractional
            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13
            09:15:23.456* with tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would
            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are
            formatted using `yaxis.hoverformat`.
        yperiod
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            period positioning in milliseconds or "M<n>" on the y
            axis. Special values in the form of "M<n>" could be
            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`
            must be a positive integer.
        yperiod0
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date
            string on the y0 axis. When `y0period` is round number
            of weeks, the `y0period0` by default would be on a
            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at
            2000-01-01.
        yperiodalignment
            Only relevant when the axis `type` is "date". Sets the
            alignment of data points on the y axis.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.
        ytype
            If "array", the heatmap's y coordinates are given by
            "y" (the default behavior when `y` is provided) If
            "scaled", the heatmap's y coordinates are given by "y0"
            and "dy" (the default behavior when `y` is not
            provided)
        z
            Sets the z data.
        zauto
            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
            with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
            bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax` Defaults to `false`
            when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
        zhoverformat
            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `z`  using d3
            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to
            those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d
            3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.By default the values
            are formatted using generic number format.
        zmax
            Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
            be set as well.
        zmid
            Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
            `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.
            Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no
            effect when `zauto` is `false`.
        zmin
            Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
            have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must
            be set as well.
        zorder
            Sets the layer on which this trace is displayed,
            relative to other SVG traces on the same subplot. SVG
            traces with higher `zorder` appear in front of those
            with lower `zorder`.
        zsmooth
            Picks a smoothing algorithm use to smooth `z` data.
        zsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `z`.
