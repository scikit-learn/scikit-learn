        The 'aaxis' property is an instance of Aaxis
        that may be specified as:
          - An instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.carpet.Aaxis`
          - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
            to the Aaxis constructor

            Supported dict properties:

                arraydtick
                    The stride between grid lines along the axis
                arraytick0
                    The starting index of grid lines along the axis
                autorange
                    Determines whether or not the range of this
                    axis is computed in relation to the input data.
                    See `rangemode` for more info. If `range` is
                    provided, then `autorange` is set to False.
                autotypenumbers
                    Using "strict" a numeric string in trace data
                    is not converted to a number. Using *convert
                    types* a numeric string in trace data may be
                    treated as a number during automatic axis
                    `type` detection. Defaults to
                    layout.autotypenumbers.
                categoryarray
                    Sets the order in which categories on this axis
                    appear. Only has an effect if `categoryorder`
                    is set to "array". Used with `categoryorder`.
                categoryarraysrc
                    Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                    for `categoryarray`.
                categoryorder
                    Specifies the ordering logic for the case of
                    categorical variables. By default, plotly uses
                    "trace", which specifies the order that is
                    present in the data supplied. Set
                    `categoryorder` to *category ascending* or
                    *category descending* if order should be
                    determined by the alphanumerical order of the
                    category names. Set `categoryorder` to "array"
                    to derive the ordering from the attribute
                    `categoryarray`. If a category is not found in
                    the `categoryarray` array, the sorting behavior
                    for that attribute will be identical to the
                    "trace" mode. The unspecified categories will
                    follow the categories in `categoryarray`.
                cheatertype

                color
                    Sets default for all colors associated with
                    this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and
                    grid colors. Grid color is lightened by
                    blending this with the plot background
                    Individual pieces can override this.
                dtick
                    The stride between grid lines along the axis
                endline
                    Determines whether or not a line is drawn at
                    along the final value of this axis. If True,
                    the end line is drawn on top of the grid lines.
                endlinecolor
                    Sets the line color of the end line.
                endlinewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the end line.
                exponentformat
                    Determines a formatting rule for the tick
                    exponents. For example, consider the number
                    1,000,000,000. If "none", it appears as
                    1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If "E", 1E+9. If
                    "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If
                    "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
                fixedrange
                    Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-
                    able. If true, then zoom is disabled.
                gridcolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                griddash
                    Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash
                    type string ("solid", "dot", "dash",
                    "longdash", "dashdot", or "longdashdot") or a
                    dash length list in px (eg "5px,10px,2px,2px").
                gridwidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
                labelalias
                    Replacement text for specific tick or hover
                    labels. For example using {US: 'USA', CA:
                    'Canada'} changes US to USA and CA to Canada.
                    The labels we would have shown must match the
                    keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or
                    ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign
                    symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular
                    ascii dash. That means you need to use âˆ’1
                    instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any
                    axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values
                    (if desired) can include html-like tags or
                    MathJax.
                labelpadding
                    Extra padding between label and the axis
                labelprefix
                    Sets a axis label prefix.
                labelsuffix
                    Sets a axis label suffix.
                linecolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                linewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
                minexponent
                    Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this
                    number
                minorgridcolor
                    Sets the color of the grid lines.
                minorgridcount
                    Sets the number of minor grid ticks per major
                    grid tick
                minorgriddash
                    Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash
                    type string ("solid", "dot", "dash",
                    "longdash", "dashdot", or "longdashdot") or a
                    dash length list in px (eg "5px,10px,2px,2px").
                minorgridwidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.
                nticks
                    Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
                    particular axis. The actual number of ticks
                    will be chosen automatically to be less than or
                    equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if
                    `tickmode` is set to "auto".
                range
                    Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type`
                    is "log", then you must take the log of your
                    desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to
                    100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis
                    `type` is "date", it should be date strings,
                    like date data, though Date objects and unix
                    milliseconds will be accepted and converted to
                    strings. If the axis `type` is "category", it
                    should be numbers, using the scale where each
                    category is assigned a serial number from zero
                    in the order it appears.
                rangemode
                    If "normal", the range is computed in relation
                    to the extrema of the input data. If *tozero*`,
                    the range extends to 0, regardless of the input
                    data If "nonnegative", the range is non-
                    negative, regardless of the input data.
                separatethousands
                    If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
                showexponent
                    If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
                    significands. If "first", only the exponent of
                    the first tick is shown. If "last", only the
                    exponent of the last tick is shown. If "none",
                    no exponents appear.
                showgrid
                    Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn.
                    If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick
                    mark.
                showline
                    Determines whether or not a line bounding this
                    axis is drawn.
                showticklabels
                    Determines whether axis labels are drawn on the
                    low side, the high side, both, or neither side
                    of the axis.
                showtickprefix
                    If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a
                    prefix. If "first", only the first tick is
                    displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the
                    last tick is displayed with a suffix. If
                    "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
                showticksuffix
                    Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
                smoothing

                startline
                    Determines whether or not a line is drawn at
                    along the starting value of this axis. If True,
                    the start line is drawn on top of the grid
                    lines.
                startlinecolor
                    Sets the line color of the start line.
                startlinewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the start line.
                tick0
                    The starting index of grid lines along the axis
                tickangle
                    Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect
                    to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle`
                    of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.
                tickfont
                    Sets the tick font.
                tickformat
                    Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3
                    formatting mini-languages which are very
                    similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h
                    ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-
                    format. And for dates see:
                    https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                    format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two
                    items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of
                    the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"
                    for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                    example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                    tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display

                type
                    Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts

            Supported dict properties:

                arraydtick
                    The stride between grid lines along the axis
                arraytick0
                    The starting index of grid lines along the axis
                autorange
                    Determines whether or not the range of this
                    axis is computed in relation to the input data.
                    See `rangemode` for more info. If `range` is
                    provided, then `autorange` is set to False.
                autotypenumbers
                    Using "strict" a numeric string in trace data
                    is not converted to a number. Using *convert
                    types* a numeric string in trace data may be
                    treated as a number during automatic axis
                    `type` detection. Defaults to
                    layout.autotypenumbers.
                categoryarray
                    Sets the order in which categories on this axis
                    appear. Only has an effect if `categoryorder`
                    is set to "array". Used with `categoryorder`.
                categoryarraysrc
                    Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                    for `categoryarray`.
                categoryorder
                    Specifies the ordering logic for the case of
                    categorical variables. By default, plotly uses
                    "trace", which specifies the order that is
                    present in the data supplied. Set
                    `categoryorder` to *category ascending* or
                    *category descending* if order should be
                    determined by the alphanumerical order of the
                    category names. Set `categoryorder` to "array"
                    to derive the ordering from the attribute
                    `categoryarray`. If a category is not found in
                    the `categoryarray` array, the sorting behavior
                    for that attribute will be identical to the
                    "trace" mode. The unspecified categories will
                    follow the categories in `categoryarray`.
                cheatertype

                color
                    Sets default for all colors associated with
                    this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and
                    grid colors. Grid color is lightened by
                    blending this with the plot background
                    Individual pieces can override this.
                dtick
                    The stride between grid lines along the axis
                endline
                    Determines whether or not a line is drawn at
                    along the final value of this axis. If True,
                    the end line is drawn on top of the grid lines.
                endlinecolor
                    Sets the line color of the end line.
                endlinewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the end line.
                exponentformat
                    Determines a formatting rule for the tick
                    exponents. For example, consider the number
                    1,000,000,000. If "none", it appears as
                    1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If "E", 1E+9. If
                    "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If
                    "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
                fixedrange
                    Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-
                    able. If true, then zoom is disabled.
                gridcolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                griddash
                    Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash
                    type string ("solid", "dot", "dash",
                    "longdash", "dashdot", or "longdashdot") or a
                    dash length list in px (eg "5px,10px,2px,2px").
                gridwidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
                labelalias
                    Replacement text for specific tick or hover
                    labels. For example using {US: 'USA', CA:
                    'Canada'} changes US to USA and CA to Canada.
                    The labels we would have shown must match the
                    keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or
                    ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign
                    symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular
                    ascii dash. That means you need to use âˆ’1
                    instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any
                    axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values
                    (if desired) can include html-like tags or
                    MathJax.
                labelpadding
                    Extra padding between label and the axis
                labelprefix
                    Sets a axis label prefix.
                labelsuffix
                    Sets a axis label suffix.
                linecolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                linewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
                minexponent
                    Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this
                    number
                minorgridcolor
                    Sets the color of the grid lines.
                minorgridcount
                    Sets the number of minor grid ticks per major
                    grid tick
                minorgriddash
                    Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash
                    type string ("solid", "dot", "dash",
                    "longdash", "dashdot", or "longdashdot") or a
                    dash length list in px (eg "5px,10px,2px,2px").
                minorgridwidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.
                nticks
                    Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
                    particular axis. The actual number of ticks
                    will be chosen automatically to be less than or
                    equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if
                    `tickmode` is set to "auto".
                range
                    Sets the range of this axis. If the axis `type`
                    is "log", then you must take the log of your
                    desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to
                    100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis
                    `type` is "date", it should be date strings,
                    like date data, though Date objects and unix
                    milliseconds will be accepted and converted to
                    strings. If the axis `type` is "category", it
                    should be numbers, using the scale where each
                    category is assigned a serial number from zero
                    in the order it appears.
                rangemode
                    If "normal", the range is computed in relation
                    to the extrema of the input data. If *tozero*`,
                    the range extends to 0, regardless of the input
                    data If "nonnegative", the range is non-
                    negative, regardless of the input data.
                separatethousands
                    If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
                showexponent
                    If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
                    significands. If "first", only the exponent of
                    the first tick is shown. If "last", only the
                    exponent of the last tick is shown. If "none",
                    no exponents appear.
                showgrid
                    Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn.
                    If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick
                    mark.
                showline
                    Determines whether or not a line bounding this
                    axis is drawn.
                showticklabels
                    Determines whether axis labels are drawn on the
                    low side, the high side, both, or neither side
                    of the axis.
                showtickprefix
                    If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a
                    prefix. If "first", only the first tick is
                    displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the
                    last tick is displayed with a suffix. If
                    "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
                showticksuffix
                    Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
                smoothing

                startline
                    Determines whether or not a line is drawn at
                    along the starting value of this axis. If True,
                    the start line is drawn on top of the grid
                    lines.
                startlinecolor
                    Sets the line color of the start line.
                startlinewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the start line.
                tick0
                    The starting index of grid lines along the axis
                tickangle
                    Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect
                    to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle`
                    of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.
                tickfont
                    Sets the tick font.
                tickformat
                    Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3
                    formatting mini-languages which are very
                    similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h
                    ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-
                    format. And for dates see:
                    https://github.com/d3/d3-time-
                    format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two
                    items to d3's date formatter: "%h" for half of
                    the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"
                    for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                    example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                    tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display

                type
                    Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts

            Sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.

        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            A two dimensional array of x coordinates at each carpet
            point. If omitted, the plot is a cheater plot and the
            xaxis is hidden by default.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            A two dimensional array of y coordinates at each carpet
            point.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.
        zorder
            Sets the layer on which this trace is displayed,
            relative to other SVG traces on the same subplot. SVG
            traces with higher `zorder` appear in front of those
            with lower `zorder`.

            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.carpet.Stream` instance or
            dict with compatible properties
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            "legendonly", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            A two dimensional array of x coordinates at each carpet
            point. If omitted, the plot is a cheater plot and the
            xaxis is hidden by default.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If "x" (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If "x2", the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `x`.
        y
            A two dimensional array of y coordinates at each carpet
            point.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If "y" (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If "y2", the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `y`.
        zorder
            Sets the layer on which this trace is displayed,
            relative to other SVG traces on the same subplot. SVG
            traces with higher `zorder` appear in front of those
            with lower `zorder`.
