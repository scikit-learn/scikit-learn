Behold, mortal, the origins of Beautiful Soup...
================================================

Leonard Richardson is the primary maintainer.

Aaron DeVore and Isaac Muse have made significant contributions to the
code base.

Mark Pilgrim provided the encoding detection code that forms the base
of UnicodeDammit.

Thomas Kluyver and Ezio Melotti finished the work of getting Beautiful
Soup 4 working under Python 3.

Simon Willison wrote soupselect, which was used to make Beautiful Soup
support CSS selectors. Isaac Muse wrote SoupSieve, which made it
possible to _remove_ the CSS selector code from Beautiful Soup.

Sam Ruby helped with a lot of edge cases.

Jonathan Ellis was awarded the prestigious Beau Potage D'Or for his
work in solving the nestable tags conundrum.
