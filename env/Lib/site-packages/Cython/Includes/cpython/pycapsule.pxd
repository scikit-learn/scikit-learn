    # This subtype of PyObject represents an opaque value, useful for
    # C extension modules who need to pass an opaque value (as a void*
    # pointer) through Python code to other C code. It is often used
    # to make a C function pointer defined in one module available to
    # other modules, so the regular import mechanism can be used to
    # access C APIs defined in dynamically loaded modules.

    # the capsule as its argument when it is destroyed.

    # passed in must also be NULL. Python uses the C function strcmp()

    # Return the current destructor stored in the capsule. On failure,
    # set an exception and return NULL.

    # a NULL return code somewhat ambiguous; use PyCapsule_IsValid()

    # Return the current context stored in the capsule. On failure,
    # set an exception and return NULL.
    #
    # It is legal for a capsule to have a NULL context. This makes a

    # Determines whether or not capsule is a valid capsule. A valid
    # capsule is non-NULL, passes PyCapsule_CheckExact(), has a

    # name parameter. (See PyCapsule_GetPointer() for information on
    # how capsule names are compared.)
    #
    # In other words, if PyCapsule_IsValid() returns a true value,
    # calls to any of the accessors (any function starting with
    # PyCapsule_Get()) are guaranteed to succeed.

    # failure.


    int PyCapsule_SetDestructor(object capsule, PyCapsule_Destructor destructor) except -1
    # Set the destructor inside capsule to destructor.

    # Return 0 on success. Return nonzero and set an exception on
    # failure.


    int PyCapsule_SetName(object capsule, const char *name) except -1
    # Set the name inside capsule to name. If non-NULL, the name must
    # outlive the capsule. If the previous name stored in the capsule
    # was not NULL, no attempt is made to free it.

    # failure.

    void* PyCapsule_Import(const char *name, int no_block) except? NULL
    # Import a pointer to a C object from a capsule attribute in a
    # module. The name parameter should specify the full name to the
    # attribute, as in module.attribute. The name stored in the
    # capsule must match this string exactly. If no_block is true,
    # import the module without blocking (using
    # PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock()). If no_block is false, import
    # the module conventionally (using PyImport_ImportModule()).
    #
    # Return the capsuleâ€™s internal pointer on success. On failure,
    # set an exception and return NULL. However, if PyCapsule_Import()
    # failed to import the module, and no_block was true, no exception
    # is set.
