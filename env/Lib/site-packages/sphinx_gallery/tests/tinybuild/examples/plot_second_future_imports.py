Testing backreferences
----------------------

This example runs after plot_future_statements.py (alphabetical ordering within
subsection) and should be unaffected by the __future__ import in
plot_future_statements.py. We should eventually update this script to actually
test this... we require Python 3 nowadays so the __future__ statements there
don't do anything. So for now let's repurpose this to look at some
backreferences. We should probably also change the filename in another PR!
