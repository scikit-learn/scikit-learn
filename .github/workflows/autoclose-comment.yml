            Thank you for your contribution to scikit-learn and for the effort you have
            put into this PR. This pull request does not yet meet the quality and
            clarity needed for an effective review. Project maintainers have limited
            time for code reviews, and our goal is to prioritize well-prepared
            contributions to keep scikit-learn maintainable.


            As the author, you are responsible for driving this PR, which entails
            presenting its context and your approach, complying with scikit-learn's
            development standards (e.g., via the docs and similar issues/PRs), fixing
            test failures, answering questions, addressing maintainer suggestions, and
            doing additional research if requested. If all that sounds demanding, that's
            because it is, and if you are a [new
            contributor](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#new-contributors),
            we recommend starting with other contribution types (e.g., reviewing PRs) to
            learn our conventions before submitting code.


            To avoid autoclose on this PR and increase the chance of a productive
            review, please refer to: [How do I improve my issue or pull
            request?](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/faq.html#how-do-i-improve-my-issue-or-pull-request)


            Scikit-learn maintainers cannot provide one-to-one guidance on this PR.
            However, as a community that values helpful discussions, we encourage you to
            ask focused questions when you are stuck (e.g., on a test failure) that show
            you have tried to investigate the problem on your own. If you engage
            genuinely (no pushing AI-generated comments or code without understanding),
            a community member might be willing to offer help or advice. 💬


            If you substantially improve this PR within two weeks, a team member may
            remove the `autoclose` label and the PR stays open. Cosmetic changes or
            incomplete fixes will not be sufficient. Maintainers will assess
            improvements on their own schedule. Please do not request label removal.
