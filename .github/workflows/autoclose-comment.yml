            ⏰ This pull request might be automatically closed in two weeks from now.


            Thank you for your contribution to scikit-learn and for the effort you have
            put into this PR. This pull request does not yet meet the quality and
            clarity needed for an effective review. Reviewing time is limited, and our
            goal is to prioritize well-prepared contributions to keep scikit-learn
            maintainable. Unless this PR is improved, it will be automatically closed
            after two weeks.


            To avoid autoclose and increase the chance of a productive review, please:

            - Ensure your contribution aligns with our
            [contribution guide](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html).

            - Include a clear motivation and concise explanation in the pull request
            description of why you chose this solution.

            - Make sure the code runs and passes tests locally (`pytest`) and in the CI.

            - Submit only code you can explain and maintain; reviewers will ask for
            clarifications and changes. Disclose any AI assistance per our
            [Automated Contributions Policy](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#automated-contributions-policy).

            - Keep the changes minimal and directly relevant to the described issue or
            enhancement.


            We cannot provide one-to-one guidance on every PR, though we
            encourage you to ask focused, actionable questions that show you have tried
            to explore the problem and are interested to engage with the project. 💬
            Sometimes a maintainer or someone else from the community might be able to
            offer pointers.


            If you improve your PR within the two-week window, the `autoclose` label can
            be removed by maintainers.
