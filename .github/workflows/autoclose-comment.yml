            This pull request has been labeled for potential autoclose.

            Thank you for your contribution to scikit-learn and for the effort you've \
            put into this PR. This pull request does not yet meet the quality and \
            clarity needed for an effective review. Reviewing time is extremely \
            limited, and PRs in this state are difficult to review effectively, which \
            can slow down progress on other contributions and ongoing work. Unless \
            this PR is improved, it will be automatically closed after two weeks.

            To avoid autoclose and increase the chance of a productive review, please:
            - Ensure your contribution aligns with our \
            [contribution guide](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html).
            - Include a clear motivation and concise explanation of what the PR does \
            in the pull request description.
            - Make sure the code runs and passes tests locally (`pytest`) and in the CI.
            - Only submit code you understand and can maintain. We will likely request \
            changes or explanations.
            - Keep the changes minimal and directly relevant to the described issue or \
            enhancement.

            If you have carefully reviewed these points but are still stuck on a \
            specific problem, please describe it in your own words. This helps \
            maintainers see that you have designed your contribution and understand \
            how it fits into the codebase, rather than submitting AI-generated or \
            copied content. We especially encourage beginners to ask focused questions \
            that show you've tried to explore the problem  and are interested to engage \
            with the project. We may be able to provide guidance if your explanation of \
            the problem is clear and reflects your own reasoning.

            We understand it can be frustrating that we cannot provide individual \
            guidance on every PR. Reviewer capacity is very limited and our goal is to \
            prioritize well-prepared contributions to keep scikit-learn maintainable.

            If you improve your PR within the two-week window, the `autoclose` label \
            can be removed by maintainers.
