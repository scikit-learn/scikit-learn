> “Any color you like.”

_Black_ is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede
control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,
determinism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time
and mental energy for more important matters.

Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting
becomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.

_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.

Try it out now using the [Black Playground](https://black.vercel.app). Watch the
[PyCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.

**[Read the documentation on ReadTheDocs!](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)**

---

## Installation and usage

### Installation

_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.6.2+ to
run. If you want to format Python 2 code as well, install with
`pip install black[python2]`.

If you can't wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:

`pip install git+git://github.com/psf/black`

### Usage

To get started right away with sensible defaults:

```sh
black {source_file_or_directory}
```

You can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:

```sh
python -m black {source_file_or_directory}
```

Further information can be found in our docs:

- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)

### NOTE: This is a beta product

_Black_ is already [successfully used](https://github.com/psf/black#used-by) by many
projects, small and big. Black has a comprehensive test suite, with efficient parallel
tests, and our own auto formatting and parallel Continuous Integration runner. However,
_Black_ is still beta. Things will probably be wonky for a while. This is made explicit
by the "Beta" trove classifier, as well as by the "b" in the version number. What this
means for you is that **until the formatter becomes stable, you should expect some
formatting to change in the future**. That being said, no drastic stylistic changes are
planned, mostly responses to bug reports.

Also, as a safety measure which slows down processing, _Black_ will check that the
reformatted code still produces a valid AST that is effectively equivalent to the
original (see the
[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#ast-before-and-after-formatting)
section for details). If you're feeling confident, use `--fast`.

## The _Black_ code style

_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in
place. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn't
take previous formatting into account (see [Pragmatism](#pragmatism) for exceptions).

Our documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are
also documented. They're both worth taking a look:

- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)
- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html)

Please refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be
intended behaviour.

### Pragmatism

Early versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its
initial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and
there were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,
_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.

- [The _Black_ code style: Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)

Please refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document
above. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.

## Configuration

_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options
from a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom
`--include` and `--exclude`/`--force-exclude`/`--extend-exclude` patterns for your
project.

You can find more details in our documentation:

- [The basics: Configuration via a file](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)

And if you're looking for more general configuration documentation:

- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)

**Pro-tip**: If you're asking yourself "Do I need to configure anything?" the answer is
"No". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults. Applying those defaults will have your
code in compliance with many other _Black_ formatted projects.

## Used by

The following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent
code style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs, SQLAlchemy,
Poetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv), pandas, Pillow,
every Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant, Zulip.

The following organizations use _Black_: Facebook, Dropbox, Mozilla, Quora.

## Testimonials

**Mike Bayer**, [author of `SQLAlchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/):

> I can't think of any single tool in my entire programming career that has given me a
> bigger productivity increase by its introduction. I can now do refactorings in about
> 1% of the keystrokes that it would have taken me previously when we had no way for
> code to format itself.

**Dusty Phillips**,
[writer](https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dusty+phillips):

> _Black_ is opinionated so you don't have to be.

**Hynek Schlawack**, [creator of `attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/), core developer of
Twisted and CPython:

> An auto-formatter that doesn't suck is all I want for Xmas!

**Carl Meyer**, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) core developer:

> At least the name is good.

**Kenneth Reitz**, creator of [`requests`](http://python-requests.org/) and
[`pipenv`](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pipenv/):

> This vastly improves the formatting of our code. Thanks a ton!

See [CHANGES](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/change_log.html).

## Authors

The author list is quite long nowadays, so it lives in its own file.

## Code of Conduct

Everyone participating in the _Black_ project, and in particular in the issue tracker,
pull requests, and social media activity, is expected to treat other people with respect
and more generally to follow the guidelines articulated in the
[Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

At the same time, humor is encouraged. In fact, basic familiarity with Monty Python's
Flying Circus is expected. We are not savages.

And if you _really_ need to slap somebody, do it with a fish while dancing.

  when formatting typing stubs. Now `Black` enforces a single empty line. (#1646)

- `Black` no longer adds an incorrect space after a parenthesized assignment expression
  in if/while statements (#1655)

- speed up caching by avoiding pathlib (#1950)

- `--diff` correctly indicates when a file doesn't end in a newline (#1662)

- Added `--stdin-filename` argument to allow stdin to respect `--force-exclude` rules
  (#1780)

- Lines ending with `fmt: skip` will now be not formatted (#1800)

- PR #2053: Black no longer relies on typed-ast for Python 3.8 and higher

- PR #2053: Python 2 support is now optional, install with
  `python3 -m pip install black[python2]` to maintain support.

- Exclude `venv` directory by default (#1683)

  Python 2 docstrings (#2037)

### _Packaging_

- Self-contained native _Black_ binaries are now provided for releases via GitHub
  Releases (#1743)

## 20.8b1

### _Packaging_

- explicitly depend on Click 7.1.2 or newer as `Black` no longer works with versions
  older than 7.0

## 20.8b0

### _Black_

- re-implemented support for explicit trailing commas: now it works consistently within
  any bracket pair, including nested structures (#1288 and duplicates)

  existing open source users of Black (#1402)

- introduced property-based fuzzing to our test suite based on Hypothesis and
  Hypothersmith (#1566)

- implemented experimental and disabled by default long string rewrapping (#1132),

  [fluent interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) style (#67)

- data structure literals (tuples, lists, dictionaries, and sets) are now also always
  exploded like imports when they don't fit in a single line (#152)

- slices are now formatted according to PEP 8 (#178)

- parentheses are now also managed automatically on the right-hand side of assignments
  and return statements (#140)

- math operators now use their respective priorities for delimiting multiline
  expressions (#148)

- optional parentheses are now omitted on expressions that start or end with a bracket
  and only contain a single operator (#177)

- empty parentheses in a class definition are now removed (#145, #180)

- string prefixes are now standardized to lowercase and `u` is removed on Python 3.6+
  only code and Python 2.7+ code with the `unicode_literals` future import (#188, #198,
  #199)

- typing stub files (`.pyi`) are now formatted in a style that is consistent with PEP
  484 (#207, #210)

- fixed trailers (content with brackets) being unnecessarily exploded into their own
  lines after a dedented closing bracket (#119)

- fixed an invalid trailing comma sometimes left in imports (#185)

- fixed non-deterministic formatting when multiple pairs of removable parentheses were
  used (#183)

- fixed multiline strings being unnecessarily wrapped in optional parentheses in long
  assignments (#215)

- fixed not splitting long from-imports with only a single name

- fixed Python 3.6+ file discovery by also looking at function calls with unpacking.
  This fixed non-deterministic formatting if trailing commas where used both in function
  signatures with stars and function calls with stars but the former would be
  reformatted to a single line.

- fixed crash on dealing with optional parentheses (#193)

- fixed "is", "is not", "in", and "not in" not considered operators for splitting
  purposes

- fixed crash when dead symlinks where encountered

## 18.4a4

## 18.4a3

- added a "cache"; files already reformatted that haven't changed on disk won't be
  reformatted again (#109)

- `--check` and `--diff` are no longer mutually exclusive (#149)

- generalized star expression handling, including double stars; this fixes
  multiplication making expressions "unsafe" for trailing commas (#132)

- _Black_ now splits imports like "Mode 3 + trailing comma" of isort (#127)

- fixed comment indentation when a standalone comment closes a block (#16, #32)

- fixed standalone comments receiving extra empty lines if immediately preceding a
  class, def, or decorator (#56, #154)

  (#2)

- fixed invalid splitting on comma in lambda arguments (#133)

- fixed missing splits of ternary expressions (#141)

## 18.4a2

- fixed parsing of unaligned standalone comments (#99, #112)

- fixed unstable formatting when encountering unnecessarily escaped quotes in a string
  (#120)

## 18.4a1

- added `--quiet` (#78)

- added automatic parentheses management (#4)

- added [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) integration (#103, #104)

- fixed reporting on `--check` with multiple files (#101, #102)

- fixed removing backslash escapes from raw strings (#100, #105)

## 18.4a0

- added `--diff` (#87)

- add line breaks before all delimiters, except in cases like commas, to better comply
  with PEP 8 (#73)

- standardize string literals to use double quotes (almost) everywhere (#75)

- fixed handling of standalone comments within nested bracketed expressions; _Black_
  will no longer produce super long lines or put all standalone comments at the end of
  the expression (#22)

- fixed 18.3a4 regression: don't crash and burn on empty lines with trailing whitespace
  (#80)

- fixed 18.3a4 regression: `# yapf: disable` usage as trailing comment would cause
  _Black_ to not emit the rest of the file (#95)

- when CTRL+C is pressed while formatting many files, _Black_ no longer freaks out with
  a flurry of asyncio-related exceptions

- only allow up to two empty lines on module level and only single empty lines within
  functions (#74)

## 18.3a4

- `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` are implemented (#5)

- automatic detection of deprecated Python 2 forms of print statements and exec
  statements in the formatted file (#49)

- use proper spaces for complex expressions in default values of typed function
  arguments (#60)

- only return exit code 1 when --check is used (#50)

- don't remove single trailing commas from square bracket indexing (#59)

- don't omit whitespace if the previous factor leaf wasn't a math operator (#55)

- omit extra space in kwarg unpacking if it's the first argument (#46)

- omit extra space in
  [Sphinx auto-attribute comments](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autodoc.html#directive-autoattribute)
  (#68)

## 18.3a3

- don't remove single empty lines outside of bracketed expressions (#19)

- added ability to pipe formatting from stdin to stdin (#25)

- restored ability to format code with legacy usage of `async` as a name (#20, #42)

- even better handling of numpy-style array indexing (#33, again)

## 18.3a2

- changed positioning of binary operators to occur at beginning of lines instead of at
  the end, following
  [a recent change to PEP 8](https://github.com/python/peps/commit/c59c4376ad233a62ca4b3a6060c81368bd21e85b)
  (#21)

- ignore empty bracket pairs while splitting. This avoids very weirdly looking
  formattings (#34, #35)

- remove a trailing comma if there is a single argument to a call

- if top level functions were separated by a comment, don't put four empty lines after
  the upper function

- fixed unstable formatting of newlines with imports

- fixed unintentional folding of post scriptum standalone comments into last statement
  if it was a simple statement (#18, #28)

- fixed missing space in numpy-style array indexing (#33)

- fixed spurious space after star-based unary expressions (#31)

## 18.3a1

- added `--check`

- only put trailing commas in function signatures and calls if it's safe to do so. If
  the file is Python 3.6+ it's always safe, otherwise only safe if there are no `*args`
  or `**kwargs` used in the signature or call. (#8)

- fixed invalid spacing of dots in relative imports (#6, #13)

- fixed invalid splitting after comma on unpacked variables in for-loops (#23)

- fixed spurious space in parenthesized set expressions (#7)

- fixed spurious space after opening parentheses and in default arguments (#14, #17)

- fixed spurious space after unary operators when the operand was a complex expression
  (#15)
