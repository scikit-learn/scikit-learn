%% a stub for obsoleted LaTeX package substitutefont
% The package substitutefont stopped being distributed with TeXLive
% around August 2023 and was moved to "obsolete" section.
% cf https://ctan.org/pkg/substitutefont
% Trying to load it raises a LaTeX build error since.

% The \substitutefont has a LaTeX kernel replacement
%     \DeclareFontFamilySubstitution
% which was added to LaTeX 2020-02-02
% The aim of this stub is to do that replacement silently.

% change this info string if making any custom modification
