        are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For

        "L<f>", where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly
        spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1,
        `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To

        digits) or "D2" (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for "D1" and
        "D2". If the axis `type` is "date", then you must convert the
        time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between
        ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. "date" also has
        special values "M<n>" gives ticks spaced by a number of months.
        `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of
        every third month, set `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to

            Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use
            with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is "log", then you
            must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set
            the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except
            when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the
            axis `type` is "date", it should be a date string, like
            date data. If the axis `type` is "category", it should
            be a number, using the scale where each category is
            assigned a serial number from zero in the order it
            appears.
        tickcolor
            Sets the tick color.
        ticklen
            Sets the tick length (in px).
        tickmode
            Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto", the number
            of ticks is set via `nticks`. If "linear", the
            placement of the ticks is determined by a starting
            position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` ("linear" is
            the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided).
            If "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
            `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. ("array" is
            the default value if `tickvals` is provided).
        ticks
            Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If "", this
            axis' ticks are not drawn. If "outside" ("inside"),
            this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.
        tickvals
            Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.
            Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to "array".
            Used with `ticktext`.
        tickvalssrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `tickvals`.
        tickwidth
            Sets the tick width (in px).
