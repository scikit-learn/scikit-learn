## Documentation üìñ

### Installation üíª

`accessible-pygments` is available through pip and conda.

You can install it through the following commands:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge accessible-pygments

# if you prefer using mamba
mamba install -c conda-forge accessible-pygments
```

```

If you prefer to install the themes directly from the source:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Quansight-Labs/accessible-pygments.git
cd accessible-pygments

pip install .
```

### Using the themes directly in your code or app

If you want to directly use the themes in your code, you can do so by importing the theme and passing it to the `style` argument of the `HtmlFormatter` class.

```python
from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter
HtmlFormatter(style='a11y-light').style
<class 'accessible-pygments.A11yLight'>
```

### Using the themes in your Sphinx documentation

1. You will need to add `accessible-pygments` as a dependency to your documentation:

   ```toml
   # for example if using a pyproject.toml file
   dependencies=["accessible-pygments"]
   ```

2. Modify your `conf.py` file to specify the `accessible-pygments` style:

   ```python
   "pygments_style": "a11y-light"
   ```

3. Build your documentation as usual.
