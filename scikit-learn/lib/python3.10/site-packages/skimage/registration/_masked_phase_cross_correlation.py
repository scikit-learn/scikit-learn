    """Masked image translation registration by masked normalized
    cross-correlation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference_image : ndarray
        Reference image.
    moving_image : ndarray
        Image to register. Must be same dimensionality as ``reference_image``,
        but not necessarily the same size.
    reference_mask : ndarray
        Boolean mask for ``reference_image``. The mask should evaluate
        to ``True`` (or 1) on valid pixels. ``reference_mask`` should
        have the same shape as ``reference_image``.
    moving_mask : ndarray or None, optional
        Boolean mask for ``moving_image``. The mask should evaluate to ``True``
        (or 1) on valid pixels. ``moving_mask`` should have the same shape
        as ``moving_image``. If ``None``, ``reference_mask`` will be used.
    overlap_ratio : float, optional
        Minimum allowed overlap ratio between images. The correlation for
        translations corresponding with an overlap ratio lower than this
        threshold will be ignored. A lower `overlap_ratio` leads to smaller
        maximum translation, while a higher `overlap_ratio` leads to greater
        robustness against spurious matches due to small overlap between
        masked images.

    Returns
    -------
    shifts : ndarray
        Shift vector (in pixels) required to register ``moving_image``
        with ``reference_image``. Axis ordering is consistent with numpy.

    """
    Masked normalized cross-correlation between arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr1 : ndarray
        First array.
    arr2 : ndarray
        Seconds array. The dimensions of `arr2` along axes that are not
        transformed should be equal to that of `arr1`.
    m1 : ndarray
        Mask of `arr1`. The mask should evaluate to `True`
        (or 1) on valid pixels. `m1` should have the same shape as `arr1`.
    m2 : ndarray
        Mask of `arr2`. The mask should evaluate to `True`
        (or 1) on valid pixels. `m2` should have the same shape as `arr2`.
    mode : {'full', 'same'}, optional
        'full':
            This returns the convolution at each point of overlap. At
            the end-points of the convolution, the signals do not overlap
            completely, and boundary effects may be seen.
        'same':
            The output is the same size as `arr1`, centered with respect
            to the `‘full’` output. Boundary effects are less prominent.
    axes : tuple of ints, optional
        Axes along which to compute the cross-correlation.
    overlap_ratio : float, optional
        Minimum allowed overlap ratio between images. The correlation for
        translations corresponding with an overlap ratio lower than this
        threshold will be ignored. A lower `overlap_ratio` leads to smaller
        maximum translation, while a higher `overlap_ratio` leads to greater
        robustness against spurious matches due to small overlap between
        masked images.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Masked normalized cross-correlation.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError : if correlation `mode` is not valid, or array dimensions along
        non-transformation axes are not equal.
