About
=====

scikit.learn is a python module for machine learning built on top of
scipy.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeu as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the AUTHORS file for a complete list of contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volonteers.


Download
========

There are currently no public releases, please see section 'Code'
below.


Dependencies
===========

The required dependencies to build the software are python >= 2.5,
NumPy >= 1.1, SciPy, the Boost libraries and a working C++ compiler.

Optional dependencies are scikits.optimization for module
machine.manifold_learning.

To run the tests you will also need nosetests and python-dap
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dap/).


Install
=======

This packages uses distutils, which is the default way of installing
python modules. The install command is::

  python setup.py install

If you have installed the boost libraries in a non-standard location
you might need to pass the appropriate --include argument so that it
find the correct headers. For example, if your headers reside in
/opt/local/include, (which is the case if you have installed them
through Mac Ports), you must issue the commands::

  python setup.py build_ext --include=/opt/local/include
  python setup.py install
