class SequentialFeatureSelector(SelectorMixin, MetaEstimatorMixin, BaseEstimator):
    """Transformer that performs Sequential Feature Selection.

    This Sequential Feature Selector adds (forward selection) or
    removes (backward selection) features to form a feature subset in a
    greedy fashion. At each stage, this estimator chooses the best feature to
    add or remove based on the cross-validation score of an estimator. In
    the case of unsupervised learning, this Sequential Feature Selector
    looks only at the features (X), not the desired outputs (y).

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <sequential_feature_selection>`.

    .. versionadded:: 0.24

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator instance
        An unfitted estimator.

    n_features_to_select : "auto", int or float, default='warn'
        If `"auto"`, the behaviour depends on the `tol` parameter:

        - if `tol` is not `None`, then features are selected until the score
          improvement does not exceed `tol`.
        - otherwise, half of the features are selected.

        If integer, the parameter is the absolute number of features to select.
        If float between 0 and 1, it is the fraction of features to select.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1
           The option `"auto"` was added in version 1.1.

        .. deprecated:: 1.1
           The default changed from `None` to `"warn"` in 1.1 and will become
           `"auto"` in 1.3. `None` and `'warn'` will be removed in 1.3.
           To keep the same behaviour as `None`, set
           `n_features_to_select="auto" and `tol=None`.

    tol : float, default=None
        If the score is not incremented by at least `tol` between two
        consecutive feature additions or removals, stop adding or removing.
        `tol` is enabled only when `n_features_to_select` is `"auto"`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    direction : {'forward', 'backward'}, default='forward'
        Whether to perform forward selection or backward selection.

    scoring : str, callable, list/tuple or dict, default=None
        A single str (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable
        (see :ref:`scoring`) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.

        NOTE that when using custom scorers, each scorer should return a single
        value. Metric functions returning a list/array of values can be wrapped
        into multiple scorers that return one value each.

        If None, the estimator's score method is used.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used. These splitters are instantiated
        with `shuffle=False` so the splits will be the same across calls.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        Number of jobs to run in parallel. When evaluating a new feature to
        add or remove, the cross-validation procedure is parallel over the
        folds.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`. Only defined if the
        underlying estimator exposes such an attribute when fit.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_features_to_select_ : int
        The number of features that were selected.

    support_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,), dtype=bool
        The mask of selected features.
