    OPTICS: Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure
    Closely related to DBSCAN, finds core sample of high density and expands
    clusters from them. Unlike DBSCAN, keeps cluster hierarchy for a variable
    neighborhood radius. Better suited for usage on large point datasets than
    the current sklearn implementation of DBSCAN.

    This implementation deviates from the original OPTICS by first performing
    k-nearest-neighborhood searches on all points to identify core sizes, then
    computing only the distances to unprocessed points when constructing the
    cluster order. Note that we do not employ a heap to manage the expansion
    candidates, so the time complexity will be O(n^2).

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <optics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_samples : int (default=5)
        The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered
        as a core point.

    max_eps : float, optional (default=np.inf)
        The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered
        as in the same neighborhood. Default value of "np.inf" will identify
        clusters across all scales; reducing ``max_eps`` will result in
        shorter run times.

    metric : string or callable, optional (default='minkowski')
        metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn
        or scipy.spatial.distance can be used.

        If metric is a callable function, it is called on each
        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable
        should take two arrays as input and return one value indicating the
        distance between them. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.

        Distance matrices are not supported.

        Valid values for metric are:

        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',
          'manhattan']

        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',
          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',
          'mahalanobis', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao',
          'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean',
          'yule']

        See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these
        metrics.

    p : integer, optional (default=2)
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        :class:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric_params : dict, optional (default=None)
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    maxima_ratio : float, optional (default=.75)
        The maximum ratio we allow of average height of clusters on the
        right and left to the local maxima in question. The higher the
        ratio, the more generous the algorithm is to preserving local
        minima, and the more cuts the resulting tree will have.

    rejection_ratio : float, optional (default=.7)
        Adjusts the fitness of the clustering. When the maxima_ratio is
        exceeded, determine which of the clusters to the left and right to
        reject based on rejection_ratio. Higher values will result in points
        being more readily classified as noise; conversely, lower values will
        result in more points being clustered.

    similarity_threshold : float, optional (default=.4)
        Used to check if nodes can be moved up one level, that is, if the
        new cluster created is too "similar" to its parent, given the
        similarity threshold. Similarity can be determined by 1) the size
        of the new cluster relative to the size of the parent node or
        2) the average of the reachability values of the new cluster
        relative to the average of the reachability values of the parent
        node. A lower value for the similarity threshold means less levels
        in the tree.

    significant_min : float, optional (default=.003)
        Sets a lower threshold on how small a significant maxima can be.

    min_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1 (default=0.005)
        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an
        absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded
        to be at least 2).

    min_maxima_ratio : float, optional (default=.001)
        Used to determine neighborhood size for minimum cluster membership.
        Each local maxima should be a largest value in a neighborhood
        of the `size min_maxima_ratio * len(X)` from left and right.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method. (default)

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, optional (default=30)
        Leaf size passed to :class:`BallTree` or :class:`KDTree`. This can
        affect the speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    core_sample_indices_ : array, shape (n_core_samples,)
        Indices of core samples.

    labels_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Cluster labels for each point in the dataset given to fit().
        Noisy samples are given the label -1.

    reachability_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Reachability distances per sample, indexed by object order. Use
        ``clust.reachability_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.

    ordering_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        The cluster ordered list of sample indices.

    core_distances_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Distance at which each sample becomes a core point, indexed by object
        order. Points which will never be core have a distance of inf. Use
        ``clust.core_distances_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.

    predecessor_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        Point that a sample was reached from, indexed by object order.
        Seed points have a predecessor of -1.

    rejection_ratio : float, optional
        Adjusts the fitness of the clustering. When the maxima_ratio is
        exceeded, determine which of the clusters to the left and right to
        reject based on rejection_ratio. Higher values will result in points
        being more readily classified as noise; conversely, lower values will
        result in more points being clustered.

    similarity_threshold : float, optional
        Used to check if nodes can be moved up one level, that is, if the
        new cluster created is too "similar" to its parent, given the
        similarity threshold. Similarity can be determined by 1) the size
        of the new cluster relative to the size of the parent node or
        2) the average of the reachability values of the new cluster
        relative to the average of the reachability values of the parent
        node. A lower value for the similarity threshold means less levels
        in the tree.

    significant_min : float, optional
        Sets a lower threshold on how small a significant maxima can be.

    min_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1
        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an
        absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded
        to be at least 2).

    min_maxima_ratio : float, optional
        Used to determine neighborhood size for minimum cluster membership.

    Returns
    -------
    core_sample_indices_ : array, shape (n_core_samples,)
        The indices of the core samples.

    labels_ : array, shape (n_samples,)
        The estimated labels.
