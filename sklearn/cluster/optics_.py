    """
    Constructs a tree structure from an OPTICS ordering and a set of
    reachability distances and extracts clusters from this structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ordering : array [n_samples]
        Indices of the samples in the order generated by OPTICS.

    reachability_distances : array [n_samples]
        Reachability distance for each sample.

    min_cluster_size : int
        The minimum size of a cluster in number of samples.

    significant_ratio : float
        The ratio for the reachability score of a local maximum
        compared to its neighbors to be considered significant.

    similarity_ratio : float
        The ratio for the reachability score of a split point
        compared to the parent split point for it to be considered
        similar.

    min_reach_ratio : float
        The ratio of the largest reachability score that a local
        maximum needs to reach in order to be considered.

    Returns
    -------
    labels : array [n_samples]
        Cluster labels for each point.  Noisy samples are given the label -1.
