"""Mean shift clustering algorithm.

Mean shift clustering aims to discover *blobs* in a smooth density of
samples. It is a centroid based algorithm, which works by updating candidates
for centroids to be the mean of the points within a given region. These
candidates are then filtered in a post-processing stage to eliminate
near-duplicates to form the final set of centroids.

Seeding is performed using a binning technique for scalability.

    cluster_all : boolean, default True
        If true, then all points are clustered, even those orphans that are

    Attributes
    ----------
    cluster_centers_ : array, [n_clusters, n_features]
        Coordinates of cluster centers.

    labels_ :
        Labels of each point.

    Notes
    -----

    Scalability:

    Because this implementation uses a flat kernel and
    a Ball Tree to look up members of each kernel, the complexity will is
    to O(T*n*log(n)) in lower dimensions, with n the number of samples
    and T the number of points. In higher dimensions the complexity will
    tend towards O(T*n^2).

    Scalability can be boosted by using fewer seeds, for example by using
    a higher value of min_bin_freq in the get_bin_seeds function.

    Note that the estimate_bandwidth function is much less scalable than the
    mean shift algorithm and will be the bottleneck if it is used.
