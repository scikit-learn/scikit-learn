class GridSearchCV(BaseSearchCV):
    """Exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator.

    Important members are fit, predict.

    GridSearchCV implements a "fit" and a "score" method.
    It also implements "predict", "predict_proba", "decision_function",
    "transform" and "inverse_transform" if they are implemented in the
    estimator used.

    The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized
    by cross-validated grid-search over a parameter grid.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <grid_search>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object.
        A object of that type is instantiated for each grid point.
        This is assumed to implement the scikit-learn estimator interface.
        Either estimator needs to provide a ``score`` function,
        or ``scoring`` must be passed.

    param_grid : dict or list of dictionaries
        Dictionary with parameters names (string) as keys and lists of
        parameter settings to try as values, or a list of such
        dictionaries, in which case the grids spanned by each dictionary
        in the list are explored. This enables searching over any sequence
        of parameter settings.

    scoring : string, callable or None, default=None
        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.
        If ``None``, the ``score`` method of the estimator is used.

    fit_params : dict, optional
        Parameters to pass to the fit method.

    n_jobs : int, default=1
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.17
           Upgraded to joblib 0.9.3.

    pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'

    iid : boolean, default=True
        If True, the data is assumed to be identically distributed across
        the folds, and the loss minimized is the total loss per sample,
        and not the mean loss across the folds.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 3-fold cross-validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
        - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator.
        - An iterable yielding train/test splits.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    refit : boolean, default=True
        Refit the best estimator with the entire dataset.
        If "False", it is impossible to make predictions using
        this GridSearchCV instance after fitting.

    verbose : integer
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

    error_score : 'raise' (default) or numeric
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
        FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit
        step, which will always raise the error.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn import svm, grid_search, datasets
    >>> iris = datasets.load_iris()
    >>> parameters = {'kernel':('linear', 'rbf'), 'C':[1, 10]}
    >>> svr = svm.SVC()
    >>> clf = grid_search.GridSearchCV(svr, parameters)

           param_grid=..., pre_dispatch=..., refit=...,
           scoring=..., verbose=...)


    Attributes
    ----------
    grid_scores_ : list of named tuples
        Contains scores for all parameter combinations in param_grid.
        Each entry corresponds to one parameter setting.
        Each named tuple has the attributes:

            * ``parameters``, a dict of parameter settings
            * ``mean_validation_score``, the mean score over the
              cross-validation folds
            * ``cv_validation_scores``, the list of scores for each fold

    best_estimator_ : estimator
        Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
        which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
        on the left out data. Not available if refit=False.

    best_score_ : float
        Score of best_estimator on the left out data.

    best_params_ : dict
        Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

    scorer_ : function
        Scorer function used on the held out data to choose the best
        parameters for the model.

    Notes
    ------
    The parameters selected are those that maximize the score of the left out
    data, unless an explicit score is passed in which case it is used instead.

    If `n_jobs` was set to a value higher than one, the data is copied for each
    point in the grid (and not `n_jobs` times). This is done for efficiency
    reasons if individual jobs take very little time, but may raise errors if
    the dataset is large and not enough memory is available.  A workaround in
    this case is to set `pre_dispatch`. Then, the memory is copied only
    `pre_dispatch` many times. A reasonable value for `pre_dispatch` is `2 *
    n_jobs`.

class RandomizedSearchCV(BaseSearchCV):
    """Randomized search on hyper parameters.


    RandomizedSearchCV implements a "fit" and a "score" method.
    It also implements "predict", "predict_proba", "decision_function",
    "transform" and "inverse_transform" if they are implemented in the
    estimator used.

    The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized
    by cross-validated search over parameter settings.

    In contrast to GridSearchCV, not all parameter values are tried out, but
    rather a fixed number of parameter settings is sampled from the specified
    distributions. The number of parameter settings that are tried is
    given by n_iter.

    If all parameters are presented as a list,
    sampling without replacement is performed. If at least one parameter
    is given as a distribution, sampling with replacement is used.
    It is highly recommended to use continuous distributions for continuous
    parameters.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <randomized_parameter_search>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object.
        A object of that type is instantiated for each grid point.
        This is assumed to implement the scikit-learn estimator interface.
        Either estimator needs to provide a ``score`` function,
        or ``scoring`` must be passed.

    param_distributions : dict
        Dictionary with parameters names (string) as keys and distributions
        or lists of parameters to try. Distributions must provide a ``rvs``
        method for sampling (such as those from scipy.stats.distributions).
        If a list is given, it is sampled uniformly.

    n_iter : int, default=10
        Number of parameter settings that are sampled. n_iter trades
        off runtime vs quality of the solution.

    scoring : string, callable or None, default=None
        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.
        If ``None``, the ``score`` method of the estimator is used.

    fit_params : dict, optional
        Parameters to pass to the fit method.

    n_jobs : int, default=1
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.

    pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'

    iid : boolean, default=True
        If True, the data is assumed to be identically distributed across
        the folds, and the loss minimized is the total loss per sample,
        and not the mean loss across the folds.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 3-fold cross-validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
        - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator.
        - An iterable yielding train/test splits.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    refit : boolean, default=True
        Refit the best estimator with the entire dataset.
        If "False", it is impossible to make predictions using
        this RandomizedSearchCV instance after fitting.

    verbose : integer
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

    random_state : int or RandomState
        Pseudo random number generator state used for random uniform sampling
        from lists of possible values instead of scipy.stats distributions.

    error_score : 'raise' (default) or numeric
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
        FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit
        step, which will always raise the error.


    Attributes
    ----------
    grid_scores_ : list of named tuples

        Each entry corresponds to one parameter setting.
        Each named tuple has the attributes:

            * ``parameters``, a dict of parameter settings
            * ``mean_validation_score``, the mean score over the
              cross-validation folds
            * ``cv_validation_scores``, the list of scores for each fold

    best_estimator_ : estimator
        Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
        which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
        on the left out data. Not available if refit=False.

    best_score_ : float
        Score of best_estimator on the left out data.

    best_params_ : dict
        Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

    Notes
    -----
    The parameters selected are those that maximize the score of the held-out
    data, according to the scoring parameter.

    If `n_jobs` was set to a value higher than one, the data is copied for each
    parameter setting(and not `n_jobs` times). This is done for efficiency
    reasons if individual jobs take very little time, but may raise errors if
