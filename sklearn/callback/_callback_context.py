# TODO(callbacks): move these explanations into a dedicated user guide.
#
# The computations tasks performed by an estimator during fit have an inherent tree
# structure, where each task can be decomposed into subtasks and so on. The root of the
# tree represents the whole fit task.
#
# Each loop in the estimator represents a parent task and each iteration of that loop
# represents a child task. To allow callbacks to be generic and reusable across
# estimators, the smallest tasks, i.e. the leaves of the task tree, correspond to
# operations on the full input data (or batch for incremental estimators).
#
# For instance, KMeans has two nested loops: the outer loop is controlled by `n_init`
# and the inner loop is controlled by `max_iter`. Its task tree looks like this:
#
# KMeans fit
# ├── init 0
# │   ├── iter 0
# │   ├── iter 1
# │   ├── ...
# │   └── iter n
# ├── init 1
# │   ├── iter 0
# │   ├── ...
# │   └── iter n
# └── init 2
#     ├── iter 0
#     ├── ...
#     └── iter n
#
# where each innermost `iter j` task corresponds the computation of the labels and
# centers for the full dataset.
#
# When the estimator is a meta-estimator, a task leaf usually corresponds to fitting
# a sub-estimator. Therefore this leaf and the root task of the sub-estimator actually
# represent the same task. In this case the leaf task of the meta-estimator and the root
# task of the sub-estimator are merged into a single task.
#
# For instance a `Pipeline` would have a task tree that looks like this:
#
# Pipeline fit
# ├── step 0 | preprocessor fit
# │   └── <insert preprocessor task tree here>
# └── step 1 | estimator fit
#     └── <insert estimator task tree here>
#
# Concretely, the tree structure is created dynamically and abstracted in an object
# named `CallbackContext`. There's a context for each task and the context is
# responsible for calling the callback hooks for its task and creating contexts for
# the child tasks.
#
# This `CallbackContext` is the object that has to be used in the implementation of an
# estimator to support callbacks. A context is created at the beginning of fit and
# then sub-contexts are created for each child task.

class CallbackContext:
    """Task level context for the callbacks.

    This class is responsible for managing the callbacks and holding the tree structure
    of an estimator's tasks. Each instance corresponds to a task of the estimator.

    Instances of this class should be created using the `__skl_init_callback_context__`
    method of its estimator or the `subcontext` method of this class.

    These contexts are passed to the callback hooks to be able to keep track of the
    position of a task in the task tree within the callbacks.
