"""Custom implementation of multiprocessing.Pool with custom pickler

This module provides efficient ways of working with data stored in
shared memory with numpy.memmap arrays without inducing any memory
copy between the parent and child processes.

This module should not be imported if multiprocessing is not
available as it implements subclasses of multiprocessing Pool
that uses a custom alternative to SimpleQueue.

    This drop-in replacement for `multiprocessing.pool.Pool` makes

    Existing instances of numpy.memmap are preserved: the child
    suprocesses will have access to the same shared memory in the

    transformed as 'r+' to avoid zeroing the original data upon
    instantiation.

    Furthermore large arrays from the parent process are automatically

    processes to access their content via memmaping (file system
    backed shared memory).

    Note: it is important to call the terminate method to collect
    the temporary folder used by the pool.

    Parameters
    ----------
    processes: int, optional
        Number of worker processes running concurrently in the pool.
    initializer: callable, optional
        Callable executed on worker process creation.
    initargs: tuple, optional
        Arguments passed to the initializer callable.
    temp_folder: str, optional
        Folder to be used by the pool for memmaping large arrays
        for sharing memory with worker processes. If None, this will try in
        order:
        - a folder pointed by the JOBLIB_TEMP_FOLDER environment variable,
        - /dev/shm if the folder exists and is writable: this is a RAMdisk
          filesystem available by default on modern Linux distributions,
        - the default system temporary folder that can be overridden
          with TMP, TMPDIR or TEMP environment variables, typically /tmp
          under Unix operating systems.
    max_nbytes int or None, optional, 1e6 by default
        Threshold on the size of arrays passed to the workers that
        triggers automated memmory mapping in temp_folder.
        Use None to disable memmaping of large arrays.
    forward_reducers: dictionary, optional
        Reducers used to pickle objects passed from master to worker
        processes: see below.
    backward_reducers: dictionary, optional
        Reducers used to pickle return values from workers back to the
        master process.
    verbose: int, optional
        Make it possible to monitor how the communication of numpy arrays
        with the subprocess is handled (pickling or memmaping)
    context_id: int, optional, None by default
        Set to a value identifying a call context to spare costly hashing of
        the content of the input arrays when it is safe to assume that each
        array will not be mutated by the parent process for the duration of the
        dispatch process. This is the case when using the high level Parallel
        API.
    prewarm: bool or str, optional, "auto" by default.
        If True, force a read on newly memmaped array to make sure that OS pre-
        cache it in memory. This can be useful to avoid concurrent disk access
        when the same data array is passed to different worker processes.
        If "auto" (by default), prewarm is set to True, unless the Linux shared
