class LogisticRegression(BaseLibLinear, ClassifierMixin, SelectorMixin):
    """Logistic Regression (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier.

    In the multiclass case, the training algorithm uses a one-vs.-all (OvA)
    scheme, rather than the "true" multinomial LR.

    This class implements L1 and L2 regularized logistic regression using the
    `liblinear` library. It can handle both dense and sparse input. Use
    C-ordered arrays or CSR matrices containing 64-bit floats for optimal
    performance; any other input format will be converted (and copied).

    Parameters
    ----------
    penalty : string, 'l1' or 'l2'
        Used to specify the norm used in the penalization

    dual : boolean
        Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only
        implemented for l2 penalty. Prefer dual=False when
        n_samples > n_features.

    C : float
        Specifies the strength of the regularization. The smaller it is
        the bigger in the regularization.

    fit_intercept : bool, default: True
        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be
        added the decision function

    intercept_scaling : float, default: 1
        when self.fit_intercept is True, instance vector x becomes
        [x, self.intercept_scaling],
        i.e. a "synthetic" feature with constant value equals to
        intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.
        The intercept becomes intercept_scaling * synthetic feature weight
        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization
        as all other features.
        To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight
        (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased

    tol: float, optional
        tolerance for stopping criteria

    scale_C : bool, default: True
        Scale C with number of samples. It makes the setting of C independent
        of the number of samples. To match liblinear commandline one should use
        scale_C=False. WARNING: scale_C will disappear in version 0.12.

    Attributes
    ----------
    `coef_` : array, shape = [n_classes-1, n_features]
        Coefficient of the features in the decision function.

        `coef_` is readonly property derived from `raw_coef_` that \
        follows the internal memory layout of liblinear.

    `intercept_` : array, shape = [n_classes-1]
        intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to the decision function.
        It is available only when parameter intercept is set to True

    LinearSVC

    Notes
    -----
    The underlying C implementation uses a random number generator to
    select features when fitting the model. It is thus not uncommon,
    to have slightly different results for the same input data. If
    that happens, try with a smaller tol parameter.
