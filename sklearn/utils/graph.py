    Returns a dictionary of shortest path lengths keyed by target.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : {sparse matrix, ndarray} of shape (n, n)
        Adjacency matrix of the graph. Sparse matrix of format LIL is
        preferred.

    source : int
       Starting node for path.

    cutoff : int, default=None
        Depth to stop the search - only paths of length <= cutoff are returned.

    --------

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist_matrix : arraylike or sparse matrix, shape = (N,N)
        Array of positive distances.
        If vertex i is connected to vertex j, then dist_matrix[i,j] gives
        the distance between the vertices.
        If vertex i is not connected to vertex j, then dist_matrix[i,j] = 0

    directed : boolean
        if True, then find the shortest path on a directed graph: only
        progress from a point to its neighbors, not the other way around.
        if False, then find the shortest path on an undirected graph: the
        algorithm can progress from a point to its neighbors and vice versa.

    method : string ['auto'|'FW'|'D']
        method to use.  Options are
        'auto' : attempt to choose the best method for the current problem
        'FW' : Floyd-Warshall algorithm.  O[N^3]
        'D' : Dijkstra's algorithm with Fibonacci stacks.  O[(k+log(N))N^2]

    Returns
    -------
    G : np.ndarray, float, shape = [N,N]
        G[i,j] gives the shortest distance from point i to point j
        along the graph.

    Notes
    -----
    As currently implemented, Dijkstra's algorithm does not work for
    graphs with direction-dependent distances when directed == False.
    i.e., if dist_matrix[i,j] and dist_matrix[j,i] are not equal and
    both are nonzero, method='D' will not necessarily yield the correct
    result.
    Also, these routines have not been tested for graphs with negative
    distances.  Negative distances can lead to infinite cycles that must
    be handled by specialized algorithms.

    For each pair of unconnected components, compute all pairwise distances

    component, which is necessary for example to compute a shortest path
    between all pairs of samples in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array of shape (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples, n_samples)
        Features to compute the pairwise distances. If `metric =
        "precomputed"`, X is the matrix of pairwise distances.

        Graph of connection between samples.

    mode : {'connectivity', 'distance'}, default='distance'
        Type of graph matrix: 'connectivity' corresponds to the connectivity
        matrix with ones and zeros, and 'distance' corresponds to the distances
        between neighbors according to the given metric.

    metric : str
        Metric used in `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances`.

    kwargs : kwargs
        Keyword arguments passed to
