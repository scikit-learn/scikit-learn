"""Splitting algorithms in the construction of a tree.

This module contains the main splitting algorithms for constructing a tree.
Splitting is concerned with finding the optimal partition of the data into
two groups. The impurity of the groups is minimized, and the impurity is measured
by some criterion, which is typically the Gini impurity or the entropy. Criterion
are implemented in the ``_criterion`` module.

Splitting evaluates a subset of features (defined by `max_features` also
known as mtry in the literature). The module supports two primary types
of splitting strategies:

- Best Split: A greedy approach to find the optimal split. This method
  ensures that the best possible split is chosen by examining various
  thresholds for each candidate feature.
- Random Split: A stochastic approach that selects a split randomly
  from a subset of the best splits. This method is faster but does
  not guarantee the optimal split.
