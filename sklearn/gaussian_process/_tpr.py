class TProcessRegressor(GaussianProcessRegressor):
    """T Process Regressor (TPR)

    This implementation is primarily based of [SW2014]. However, due to their unusual
    parametrization of the Student T distribution [TW2018] is also referenced.
    Lastly the kernel parameter optimization is largely based off [RW2006] as was
    done in GPs

    In addition to the gaussian process regressor (._gpr.GaussianProcessRegressor),
    :class:`TProcessRegressor`:

        * allows variance of predictions to be predicted
        * allows variance of predictions to scaled using Bayesian Methods

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel : kernel instance, default=None
        The kernel specifying the covariance function of the TP. Unlike a GP, the
        covariance function is used to construct the shape parameter of the
        inverse-gamma prior over the multivariate normal's covariance matrix.

    v : float, default=2
        The starting degrees of freedom of the multivariate T distribution. As
        observations are added, the degrees of freedom will increase. This
        value orriginates as the degrees of freedom of the inverse gamma prior.

    alpha : float or ndarray of shape (n_samples,), default=1e-10
        Value added to the diagonal of the kernel matrix during fitting.
        This can prevent a potential numerical issue during fitting, by
        ensuring that the calculated values form a positive definite matrix.
        It can also be interpreted as the variance of additional Gaussian
        measurement noise on the training observations. Note however this is
        not independent noise, it is noise added to kernel's prior. Further note,
        that this is different from using a `WhiteKernel`. If an array is passed,
        it must have the same number of entries as the data used for fitting and is
        used as datapoint-dependent noise level. Allowing to specify the
        noise level directly as a parameter is mainly for convenience and
        for consistency with :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.Ridge`.

    optimizer : "fmin_l_bfgs_b", callable or None, default="fmin_l_bfgs_b"
        Can either be one of the internally supported optimizers for optimizing
        the kernel's parameters, specified by a string, or an externally
        defined optimizer passed as a callable. If a callable is passed, it
        must have the signature::

            def optimizer(obj_func, initial_theta, bounds):
                # * 'obj_func': the objective function to be minimized, which
                #   takes the hyperparameters theta as a parameter and an
                #   optional flag eval_gradient, which determines if the
                #   gradient is returned additionally to the function value
                # * 'initial_theta': the initial value for theta, which can be
                #   used by local optimizers
                # * 'bounds': the bounds on the values of theta
                ....
                # Returned are the best found hyperparameters theta and
                # the corresponding value of the target function.
                return theta_opt, func_min

        Per default, the L-BFGS-B algorithm from `scipy.optimize.minimize`
        is used. If None is passed, the kernel's parameters are kept fixed.
        Available internal optimizers are: `{'fmin_l_bfgs_b'}`.

    n_restarts_optimizer : int, default=0
        The number of restarts of the optimizer for finding the kernel's
        parameters which maximize the log-marginal likelihood. The first run
        of the optimizer is performed from the kernel's initial parameters,
        the remaining ones (if any) from thetas sampled log-uniform randomly
        from the space of allowed theta-values. If greater than 0, all bounds
        must be finite. Note that `n_restarts_optimizer == 0` implies that one
        run is performed.

    normalize_y : bool, default=False
        Whether or not to normalize the target values `y` by removing the mean
        and scaling to unit-variance. This is recommended for cases where
        zero-mean, unit-variance priors are used. Note that, in this
        implementation, the normalisation is reversed before the GP predictions
        are reported.

    copy_X_train : bool, default=True
        If True, a persistent copy of the training data is stored in the
        object. Otherwise, just a reference to the training data is stored,
        which might cause predictions to change if the data is modified
        externally.

    n_targets : int, default=None
        The number of dimensions of the target values. Used to decide the number
        of outputs when sampling from the prior distributions (i.e. calling
        :meth:`sample_y` before :meth:`fit`). This parameter is ignored once
        :meth:`fit` has been called.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation used to initialize the centers.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    X_train_ : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features) or list of object
        Feature vectors or other representations of training data (also
        required for prediction).

    y_train_ : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)
        Target values in training data (also required for prediction).

    kernel_ : kernel instance
        The kernel used for prediction. The structure of the kernel is the
        same as the one passed as parameter but with optimized hyperparameters.

    L_ : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Lower-triangular Cholesky decomposition of the kernel in ``X_train_``.

    alpha_ : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Dual coefficients of training data points in kernel space.

    log_marginal_likelihood_value_ : float
        The log-marginal-likelihood of ``self.kernel_.theta``.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.
