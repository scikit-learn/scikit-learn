    This warning occurs when some input data needs to be converted or

    For example, this warning may occur when the user
        - passes an integer array to a function which expects float input and
          will convert the input
        - requests a non-copying operation, but a copy is required to meet the

    the dimensionality of the original source space, to imply that the
