class KernelRidge(RegressorMixin, BaseKernelRidge):
    """Kernel ridge regression.

    Kernel ridge regression (KRR) combines ridge regression (linear least
    squares with l2-norm regularization) with the kernel trick. It thus
    learns a linear function in the space induced by the respective kernel and
    the data. For non-linear kernels, this corresponds to a non-linear
    function in the original space.

    The form of the model learned by KRR is identical to support vector
    regression (SVR). However, different loss functions are used: KRR uses
    squared error loss while support vector regression uses epsilon-insensitive
    loss, both combined with l2 regularization. In contrast to SVR, fitting a
    KRR model can be done in closed-form and is typically faster for
    medium-sized datasets. On the other  hand, the learned model is non-sparse
    and thus slower than SVR, which learns a sparse model for epsilon > 0, at
    prediction-time.

    This estimator has built-in support for multi-variate regression
    (i.e., when y is a 2d-array of shape [n_samples, n_targets]).

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <kernel_ridge>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : {float, array-like}, shape = [n_targets]
        Small positive values of alpha improve the conditioning of the problem
        and reduce the variance of the estimates.  Alpha corresponds to
        ``(2*C)^-1`` in other linear models such as LogisticRegression or
        LinearSVC. If an array is passed, penalties are assumed to be specific
        to the targets. Hence they must correspond in number.

    kernel : string or callable, default="linear"
        Kernel mapping used internally. A callable should accept two arguments
        and the keyword arguments passed to this object as kernel_params, and
        should return a floating point number.

    gamma : float, default=None
        Gamma parameter for the RBF, laplacian, polynomial, exponential chi2
        and sigmoid kernels. Interpretation of the default value is left to
        the kernel; see the documentation for sklearn.metrics.pairwise.
        Ignored by other kernels.

    degree : float, default=3
        Degree of the polynomial kernel. Ignored by other kernels.

    coef0 : float, default=1
        Zero coefficient for polynomial and sigmoid kernels.
        Ignored by other kernels.

    kernel_params : mapping of string to any, optional
        Additional parameters (keyword arguments) for kernel function passed
        as callable object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dual_coef_ : array, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_targets]
        Representation of weight vector(s) in kernel space

    X_fit_ : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = [n_samples, n_features]
        Training data, which is also required for prediction
