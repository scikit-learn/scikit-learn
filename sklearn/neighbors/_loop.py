class LocalOutlierProbabilities(KNeighborsMixin, OutlierMixin, NeighborsBase):
    """Unsupervised Outlier Detection using the Local Outlier Probabilities (LoOP).

    The anomaly detection method LoOP computes an outlier score that is
    between 0.0 (normal) and 1.0 (anomalous), roughly resembling a probability.
    It uses a simplified version of the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) that does
    not use the reachability distances of LOF, along with a simple deviation model
    for score normalization.
    Similar to LOF, it compares the density of a point to the densities of
    its neighbor points, where both the density estimate and the neighbors
    are based on the (distances to the) k-nearest neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, default=20
        Number of neighbors to use by default for :meth:`kneighbors` queries.
        If n_neighbors is larger than the number of samples provided,
        all samples will be used.

    n_lambda : float, default=2
        Normalization scaling factor in the score normalization that controls
        the score contrast, roughly resembling the number of standard deviations
        (of the density factor) that define the threshold for anomalies.
        A smaller value will produce higher probabilities, but also lose
        ranking contrast on the outliers, a larger value may squeeze scores
        to 0 too much. This parameter does not affect the ranking, and
        hence will usually not need typical hyperparameter tuning, but
        may improve interpretability of the probability-like values.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, default=30
        Leaf is size passed to :class:`BallTree` or :class:`KDTree`. This can
        affect the speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    metric : str or callable, default='minkowski'
        Metric to use for distance computation. Default is "minkowski", which
        results in the standard Euclidean distance when p = 2. See the
        documentation of `scipy.spatial.distance
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html>`_ and
        the metrics listed in
        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.distance_metrics` for valid metric
        values.

        If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
        must be square during fit. X may be a :term:`sparse graph`, in which
        case only "nonzero" elements may be considered neighbors.

        If metric is a callable function, it takes two arrays representing 1D
        vectors as inputs and must return one value indicating the distance
        between those vectors. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.

    p : float, default=2
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this
        is equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    contamination : 'auto' or float, default='auto'
        The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion
        of outliers in the data set. When fitting this is used to define the
        threshold on the scores of the samples.

        - if 'auto', the threshold is determined as in the
          original paper,
        - if a float, the contamination should be in the range (0, 0.5].

    novelty : bool, default=False
        By default, LocalOutlierProbabilities is only meant to be used for
        outlier detection (novelty=False). Set novelty to True if you want to
        use LocalOutlierProbabilities for novelty detection. In this case be
        aware that you should only use predict, decision_function and
        score_samples on new unseen data and not on the training set;
        and note that the results obtained this way may differ from the
        standard LoOP results.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    negative_outlier_probabilities_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        The negative outlier probabilities, for consistency with other parts
        of the scikit-learn API (e.g., OCSVM). A value close to 0 indicates
        a normal point, a value close to -1 indicates an outlier.

    n_neighbors_ : int
        The actual number of neighbors used for :meth:`kneighbors` queries.

    offset_ : float
        Offset used to obtain binary labels from the raw scores.
        Observations having negative_outlier_probabilities_ smaller than
        `offset_` are detected as abnormal.
        The offset is set to -0.5 (inliers score around -1), except when a
        contamination parameter different than "auto" is provided. In that
        case, the offset is defined in such a way we obtain the expected
        number of outliers in training.

    effective_metric_ : str
        The effective metric used for the distance computation.

    effective_metric_params_ : dict
        The effective additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    n_samples_fit_ : int
        It is the number of samples in the fitted data.
