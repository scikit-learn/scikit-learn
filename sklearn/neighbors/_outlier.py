class NearestNeighborOutlierDetection(KNeighborsMixin, OutlierMixin, NeighborsBase):
    """Unsupervised Outlier Detection using the kNN distance.

    One of the earliest and simplest, yet effective, outlier detection
    methods is the distance (or the sum of distances) to the k-nearest neighbor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, default=10
        Number of neighbors to use by default for :meth:`kneighbors` queries.
        If n_neighbors is larger than the number of samples provided,
        all samples will be used.

    weighting : {'max', 'sum'}, default='max'
        How the score is computed:

        - 'max' or 'knn' uses the distance to the kth nearest neighbor,
          the standard kNN outlier detection version of Ramaswamy et al.
        - 'sum', 'weight' or 'knnweight' uses the sum of distances to the
          k nearest neighbors, a variant due to Angiulli and Pizzuti

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`KDTree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, default=30
        Leaf is size passed to :class:`BallTree` or :class:`KDTree`. This can
        affect the speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    metric : str or callable, default='minkowski'
        Metric to use for distance computation. Default is "minkowski", which
        results in the standard Euclidean distance when p = 2. See the
        documentation of `scipy.spatial.distance
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html>`_ and
        the metrics listed in
        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise.distance_metrics` for valid metric
        values.

        If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
        must be square during fit. X may be a :term:`sparse graph`, in which
        case only "nonzero" elements may be considered neighbors.

        If metric is a callable function, it takes two arrays representing 1D
        vectors as inputs and must return one value indicating the distance
        between those vectors. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less
        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.

    p : float, default=2
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this
        is equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    contamination : float, default='0.01'
        The amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion
        of outliers in the data set. When fitting this is used to define the
        threshold on the scores of the samples.

        Because the kNN distances (in contrast to LOF and LoOP) do not
        provide a heuristic for this parameter, it defaults to 0.01
        corresponding to labeling 1% of the data as outliers.

        The contamination should usually be in the range (0, 0.5].

    novelty : bool, default=False
        By default, NearestNeighborOutlierDetection is only meant to be used
        for outlier detection (novelty=False). Set novelty to True if you want
        to use NearestNeighborOutlierDetection for novelty detection. In this
        case be aware that you should only use predict, decision_function and
        score_samples on new unseen data and not on the training set;
        and note that the results obtained this way may differ from the
        standard kNN results.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    negative_knn_distances_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        The negative kNN distances, for consistency with other parts
        of the scikit-learn API (e.g., OCSVM). A value close to 0 indicates
        a normal point, a negative value indicates outliers. The numeric range
        depends on the data set, preprocessing, and metric, and cannot be
        compared across data sets.

    n_neighbors_ : int
        The actual number of neighbors used for :meth:`kneighbors` queries.

    offset_ : float
        Offset used to obtain binary labels from the raw scores.
        Observations having negative_knn_distances_ smaller than
        `offset_` are detected as abnormal.
        The offset is defined such that the expected amount of outliers
        in training specified by the contamination parameter is flagged.

    effective_metric_ : str
        The effective metric used for the distance computation.

    effective_metric_params_ : dict
        The effective additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    n_samples_fit_ : int
        It is the number of samples in the fitted data.
