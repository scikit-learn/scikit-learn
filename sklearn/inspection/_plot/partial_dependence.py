    """Partial dependence (PD) and individual conditional expectation (ICE)
    plots.

    Partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectation plots or an
    overlay of both of them can be plotted by setting the ``kind``
    parameter.
    The ``len(features)`` plots are arranged in a grid with ``n_cols``
    columns. Two-way partial dependence plots are plotted as contour plots. The
    deciles of the feature values will be shown with tick marks on the x-axes
    for one-way plots, and on both axes for two-way plots.

        :func:`plot_partial_dependence` does not support using the same axes
        with multiple calls. To plot the the partial dependence for multiple
        estimators, please pass the axes created by the first call to the
        second call::

    .. warning::

        For :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, the
        `'recursion'` method (used by default) will not account for the `init`
        predictor of the boosting process. In practice, this will produce
        the same values as `'brute'` up to a constant offset in the target
        response, provided that `init` is a constant estimator (which is the
        default). However, if `init` is not a constant estimator, the
        partial dependence values are incorrect for `'recursion'` because the
        offset will be sample-dependent. It is preferable to use the `'brute'`
        method. Note that this only applies to
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, not to
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and
        :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : BaseEstimator
        A fitted estimator object implementing :term:`predict`,
        :term:`predict_proba`, or :term:`decision_function`.
        Multioutput-multiclass classifiers are not supported.

    X : {array-like or dataframe} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        ``X`` is used to generate a grid of values for the target
        ``features`` (where the partial dependence will be evaluated), and
        also to generate values for the complement features when the
        `method` is `'brute'`.

    features : list of {int, str, pair of int, pair of str}
        The target features for which to create the PDPs.
        If `features[i]` is an integer or a string, a one-way PDP is created;
        if `features[i]` is a tuple, a two-way PDP is created (only supported
        with `kind='average'`). Each tuple must be of size 2.
        if any entry is a string, then it must be in ``feature_names``.

    feature_names : array-like of shape (n_features,), dtype=str, default=None
        Name of each feature; `feature_names[i]` holds the name of the feature
        with index `i`.
        By default, the name of the feature corresponds to their numerical
        index for NumPy array and their column name for pandas dataframe.

    target : int, default=None
        - In a multiclass setting, specifies the class for which the PDPs
          should be computed. Note that for binary classification, the
          positive class (index 1) is always used.
        - In a multioutput setting, specifies the task for which the PDPs
          should be computed.

        Ignored in binary classification or classical regression settings.

    response_method : {'auto', 'predict_proba', 'decision_function'}, \
            default='auto'
        Specifies whether to use :term:`predict_proba` or
        :term:`decision_function` as the target response. For regressors
        this parameter is ignored and the response is always the output of
        :term:`predict`. By default, :term:`predict_proba` is tried first
        and we revert to :term:`decision_function` if it doesn't exist. If
        ``method`` is `'recursion'`, the response is always the output of
        :term:`decision_function`.

    n_cols : int, default=3
        The maximum number of columns in the grid plot. Only active when `ax`
        is a single axis or `None`.

    grid_resolution : int, default=100
        The number of equally spaced points on the axes of the plots, for each
        target feature.

    percentiles : tuple of float, default=(0.05, 0.95)
        The lower and upper percentile used to create the extreme values
        for the PDP axes. Must be in [0, 1].

    method : str, default='auto'
        The method used to calculate the averaged predictions:

        - `'recursion'` is only supported for some tree-based estimators
          (namely
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`,
          :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`
          but is more efficient in terms of speed.
          With this method, the target response of a
          classifier is always the decision function, not the predicted
          probabilities. Since the `'recursion'` method implicitely computes
          the average of the ICEs by design, it is not compatible with ICE and
          thus `kind` must be `'average'`.

        - `'brute'` is supported for any estimator, but is more
          computationally intensive.

        - `'auto'`: the `'recursion'` is used for estimators that support it,
          and `'brute'` is used otherwise.

        Please see :ref:`this note <pdp_method_differences>` for
        differences between the `'brute'` and `'recursion'` method.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of CPUs to use to compute the partial dependences.
        Computation is parallelized over features specified by the `features`
        parameter.

        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Verbose output during PD computations.

    line_kw : dict, default=None
        Dict with keywords passed to the ``matplotlib.pyplot.plot`` call.
        For one-way partial dependence plots.

    ice_lines_kw : dict, default=None
        Dictionary with keywords passed to the `matplotlib.pyplot.plot` call.
        For ICE lines in the one-way partial dependence plots.
        Takes priority over `line_kw` when not `None`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    pd_line_kw : dict, default=None
        Dictionary with keywords passed to the `matplotlib.pyplot.plot` call.
        For partial dependence in one-way partial dependence plots.
        Takes priority over `line_kw` when not `None`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    contour_kw : dict, default=None
        Dict with keywords passed to the ``matplotlib.pyplot.contourf`` call.
        For two-way partial dependence plots.

    ax : Matplotlib axes or array-like of Matplotlib axes, default=None
        - If a single axis is passed in, it is treated as a bounding axes
          and a grid of partial dependence plots will be drawn within
          these bounds. The `n_cols` parameter controls the number of
          columns in the grid.
        - If an array-like of axes are passed in, the partial dependence
          plots will be drawn directly into these axes.
        - If `None`, a figure and a bounding axes is created and treated
          as the single axes case.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    kind : {'average', 'individual', 'both'}, default='average'
        Whether to plot the partial dependence averaged across all the samples
        in the dataset or one line per sample or both.

        - ``kind='average'`` results in the traditional PD plot;
        - ``kind='individual'`` results in the ICE plot.

       Note that the fast ``method='recursion'`` option is only available for
       ``kind='average'``. Plotting individual dependencies requires using the
       slower ``method='brute'`` option.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    subsample : float, int or None, default=1000
        Sampling for ICE curves when `kind` is 'individual' or 'both'.
        If `float`, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of the dataset to be used to plot ICE curves. If `int`, represents the
        absolute number samples to use.

        Note that the full dataset is still used to calculate averaged partial
        dependence when `kind='both'`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the selected samples when subsamples is not
        `None` and `kind` is either `'both'` or `'individual'`.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

        or a numpy array of axes, `bounding_ax_` is None.

    axes_ : ndarray of matplotlib Axes
        If `ax` is an axes or None, `axes_[i, j]` is the axes on the i-th row
        and j-th column. If `ax` is a list of axes, `axes_[i]` is the i-th item
        in `ax`. Elements that are None correspond to a nonexisting axes in
        that position.

    lines_ : ndarray of matplotlib Artists
        If `ax` is an axes or None, `lines_[i, j]` is the partial dependence
        curve on the i-th row and j-th column. If `ax` is a list of axes,
        `lines_[i]` is the partial dependence curve corresponding to the i-th
        item in `ax`. Elements that are None correspond to a nonexisting axes
        or an axes that does not include a line plot.

    deciles_vlines_ : ndarray of matplotlib LineCollection
        If `ax` is an axes or None, `vlines_[i, j]` is the line collection
        representing the x axis deciles of the i-th row and j-th column. If
        `ax` is a list of axes, `vlines_[i]` corresponds to the i-th item in
        `ax`. Elements that are None correspond to a nonexisting axes or an
        axes that does not include a PDP plot.

    deciles_hlines_ : ndarray of matplotlib LineCollection
        If `ax` is an axes or None, `vlines_[i, j]` is the line collection
        representing the y axis deciles of the i-th row and j-th column. If
        `ax` is a list of axes, `vlines_[i]` corresponds to the i-th item in
        `ax`. Elements that are None correspond to a nonexisting axes or an
        axes that does not include a 2-way plot.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23
