    Linear programming: minimize a linear objective function subject to linear
    equality and inequality constraints.

    Linear programming solves problems of the following form:

    .. math::

        \min_x \ & c^T x \\
        \mbox{such that} \ & A_{ub} x \leq b_{ub},\\
        & A_{eq} x = b_{eq},\\
        & l \leq x \leq u ,

    where :math:`x` is a vector of decision variables; :math:`c`,
    :math:`b_{ub}`, :math:`b_{eq}`, :math:`l`, and :math:`u` are vectors; and
    :math:`A_{ub}` and :math:`A_{eq}` are matrices.

    Informally, that's:

    minimize::

        c @ x

    such that::

        A_ub @ x <= b_ub
        A_eq @ x == b_eq
        lb <= x <= ub

    Note that by default ``lb = 0`` and ``ub = None`` unless specified with
    ``bounds``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1D array
        The coefficients of the linear objective function to be minimized.
    A_ub : 2D array, optional
        The inequality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_ub`` specifies the
        coefficients of a linear inequality constraint on ``x``.
    b_ub : 1D array, optional
        The inequality constraint vector. Each element represents an
        upper bound on the corresponding value of ``A_ub @ x``.
    A_eq : 2D array, optional
        The equality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_eq`` specifies the
        coefficients of a linear equality constraint on ``x``.
    b_eq : 1D array, optional
        The equality constraint vector. Each element of ``A_eq @ x`` must equal
        the corresponding element of ``b_eq``.
    bounds : sequence, optional
        A sequence of ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in ``x``, defining
        the minimum and maximum values of that decision variable. Use ``None`` to
        indicate that there is no bound. By default, bounds are ``(0, None)``
        (all decision variables are non-negative).
        If a single tuple ``(min, max)`` is provided, then ``min`` and
        ``max`` will serve as bounds for all decision variables.
    method : {'interior-point', 'revised simplex', 'simplex'}, optional
        The algorithm used to solve the standard form problem.
        :ref:`'interior-point' <optimize.linprog-interior-point>` (default),
        :ref:`'revised simplex' <optimize.linprog-revised_simplex>`, and
        :ref:`'simplex' <optimize.linprog-simplex>` (legacy)
        are supported.
    callback : callable, optional
        If a callback function is provided, it will be called at least once per
        iteration of the algorithm. The callback function must accept a single
        `scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult` consisting of the following fields:

                ``True`` when the algorithm has completed successfully.
            slack : 1D array
                The (nominally positive) values of the slack,
                ``b_ub - A_ub @ x``.
            con : 1D array
                The (nominally zero) residuals of the equality constraints,
                ``b_eq - A_eq @ x``.
            phase : int
                The phase of the algorithm being executed.
            status : int

            nit : int
                The current iteration number.
            message : str
                A string descriptor of the algorithm status.

    options : dict, optional
        A dictionary of solver options. All methods accept the following
        options:

            maxiter : int
                Maximum number of iterations to perform.
            disp : bool
                Set to ``True`` to print convergence messages.

        For method-specific options, see
        :func:`show_options('linprog') <show_options>`.

    x0 : 1D array, optional
        Guess values of the decision variables, which will be refined by
        the optimization algorithm. This argument is currently used only by the
        'revised simplex' method, and can only be used if `x0` represents a
        basic feasible solution.

    Notes
    -----
    This section describes the available solvers that can be selected by the
    'method' parameter.

    :ref:`'interior-point' <optimize.linprog-interior-point>` is the default
    as it is typically the fastest and most robust method.
    :ref:`'revised simplex' <optimize.linprog-revised_simplex>` is more
    accurate for the problems it solves.
    :ref:`'simplex' <optimize.linprog-simplex>` is the legacy method and is
    included for backwards compatibility and educational purposes.

    Method *interior-point* uses the primal-dual path following algorithm
    as outlined in [4]_. This algorithm supports sparse constraint matrices and
    is typically faster than the simplex methods, especially for large, sparse
    problems. Note, however, that the solution returned may be slightly less
    accurate than those of the simplex methods and will not, in general,
    correspond with a vertex of the polytope defined by the constraints.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0.0

    Method *revised simplex* uses the revised simplex method as decribed in
    [9]_, except that a factorization [11]_ of the basis matrix, rather than
    its inverse, is efficiently maintained and used to solve the linear systems
    at each iteration of the algorithm.

    .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

    Method *simplex* uses a traditional, full-tableau implementation of
    Dantzig's simplex algorithm [1]_, [2]_ (*not* the
    Nelder-Mead simplex). This algorithm is included for backwards
    compatibility and educational purposes.

    .. versionadded:: 0.15.0

    Before applying any method, a presolve procedure based on [8]_ attempts
    to identify trivial infeasibilities, trivial unboundedness, and potential
    problem simplifications. Specifically, it checks for:

    - rows of zeros in ``A_eq`` or ``A_ub``, representing trivial constraints;
    - columns of zeros in ``A_eq`` `and` ``A_ub``, representing unconstrained
      variables;
    - column singletons in ``A_eq``, representing fixed variables; and
    - column singletons in ``A_ub``, representing simple bounds.

    If presolve reveals that the problem is unbounded (e.g. an unconstrained
    and unbounded variable has negative cost) or infeasible (e.g. a row of
    zeros in ``A_eq`` corresponds with a nonzero in ``b_eq``), the solver
    terminates with the appropriate status code. Note that presolve terminates
    as soon as any sign of unboundedness is detected; consequently, a problem
    may be reported as unbounded when in reality the problem is infeasible
    (but infeasibility has not been detected yet). Therefore, if it is
    important to know whether the problem is actually infeasible, solve the
    problem again with option ``presolve=False``.

    If neither infeasibility nor unboundedness are detected in a single pass
    of the presolve, bounds are tightened where possible and fixed
    variables are removed from the problem. Then, linearly dependent rows
    of the ``A_eq`` matrix are removed, (unless they represent an
    infeasibility) to avoid numerical difficulties in the primary solve
    routine. Note that rows that are nearly linearly dependent (within a
    prescribed tolerance) may also be removed, which can change the optimal
    solution in rare cases. If this is a concern, eliminate redundancy from
    your problem formulation and run with option ``rr=False`` or
    ``presolve=False``.

    Several potential improvements can be made here: additional presolve
    checks outlined in [8]_ should be implemented, the presolve routine should
    be run multiple times (until no further simplifications can be made), and
    more of the efficiency improvements from [5]_ should be implemented in the
    redundancy removal routines.

    After presolve, the problem is transformed to standard form by converting
    the (tightened) simple bounds to upper bound constraints, introducing
    non-negative slack variables for inequality constraints, and expressing
    unbounded variables as the difference between two non-negative variables.
    The selected algorithm solves the standard form problem, and a
    postprocessing routine converts this to a solution to the original problem.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider the following problem:

    .. math::

        \min_{x_0, x_1} \ -x_0 + 4x_1 & \\
        \mbox{such that} \ -3x_0 + x_1 & \leq 6,\\
        -x_0 - 2x_1 & \geq -4,\\
        x_1 & \geq -3.

    The problem is not presented in the form accepted by `linprog`. This is
    easily remedied by converting the "greater than" inequality
    constraint to a "less than" inequality constraint by
    multiplying both sides by a factor of :math:`-1`. Note also that the last
    constraint is really the simple bound :math:`-3 \leq x_1 \leq \infty`.
    Finally, since there are no bounds on :math:`x_0`, we must explicitly
    specify the bounds :math:`-\infty \leq x_0 \leq \infty`, as the
    default is for variables to be non-negative. After collecting coeffecients
    into arrays and tuples, the input for this problem is:

    >>> c = [-1, 4]
    >>> A = [[-3, 1], [1, 2]]
    >>> b = [6, 4]
    >>> x0_bounds = (None, None)
    >>> x1_bounds = (-3, None)
    >>> from scipy.optimize import linprog
    >>> res = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds])

    Note that the default method for `linprog` is 'interior-point', which is
    approximate by nature.
