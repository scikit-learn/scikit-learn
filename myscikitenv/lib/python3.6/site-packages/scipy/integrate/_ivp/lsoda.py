class LSODA(OdeSolver):
    """Adams/BDF method with automatic stiffness detection and switching.

    This is a wrapper to the Fortran solver from ODEPACK [1]_. It switches
    automatically between the nonstiff Adams method and the stiff BDF method.
    The method was originally detailed in [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Right-hand side of the system. The calling signature is ``fun(t, y)``.
        Here ``t`` is a scalar, and there are two options for the ndarray ``y``:
        It can either have shape (n,); then ``fun`` must return array_like with
        shape (n,). Alternatively it can have shape (n, k); then ``fun``
        must return an array_like with shape (n, k), i.e. each column
        corresponds to a single column in ``y``. The choice between the two
        options is determined by `vectorized` argument (see below). The
        vectorized implementation allows a faster approximation of the Jacobian
        by finite differences (required for this solver).
    t0 : float
        Initial time.
    y0 : array_like, shape (n,)
        Initial state.
    t_bound : float
        Boundary time - the integration won't continue beyond it. It also
        determines the direction of the integration.
    first_step : float or None, optional
        Initial step size. Default is ``None`` which means that the algorithm
        should choose.
    min_step : float, optional
        Minimum allowed step size. Default is 0.0, i.e. the step size is not
        bounded and determined solely by the solver.
    max_step : float, optional
        Maximum allowed step size. Default is np.inf, i.e. the step size is not
        bounded and determined solely by the solver.
    rtol, atol : float and array_like, optional
        Relative and absolute tolerances. The solver keeps the local error
        estimates less than ``atol + rtol * abs(y)``. Here `rtol` controls a
        relative accuracy (number of correct digits). But if a component of `y`
        is approximately below `atol`, the error only needs to fall within
        the same `atol` threshold, and the number of correct digits is not
        guaranteed. If components of y have different scales, it might be
        beneficial to set different `atol` values for different components by
        passing array_like with shape (n,) for `atol`. Default values are
        1e-3 for `rtol` and 1e-6 for `atol`.
    jac : None or callable, optional
        Jacobian matrix of the right-hand side of the system with respect to
        ``y``. The Jacobian matrix has shape (n, n) and its element (i, j) is
        equal to ``d f_i / d y_j``. The function will be called as
        ``jac(t, y)``. If None (default), the Jacobian will be
        approximated by finite differences. It is generally recommended to
        provide the Jacobian rather than relying on a finite-difference
        approximation.
    lband, uband : int or None
        Parameters defining the bandwidth of the Jacobian,
        i.e., ``jac[i, j] != 0 only for i - lband <= j <= i + uband``. Setting
        these requires your jac routine to return the Jacobian in the packed format:
        the returned array must have ``n`` columns and ``uband + lband + 1``
        rows in which Jacobian diagonals are written. Specifically
        ``jac_packed[uband + i - j , j] = jac[i, j]``. The same format is used
        in `scipy.linalg.solve_banded` (check for an illustration).
        These parameters can be also used with ``jac=None`` to reduce the
        number of Jacobian elements estimated by finite differences.
    vectorized : bool, optional
        Whether `fun` is implemented in a vectorized fashion. A vectorized
        implementation offers no advantages for this solver. Default is False.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of equations.
    status : string
        Current status of the solver: 'running', 'finished' or 'failed'.
    t_bound : float
        Boundary time.
    direction : float
        Integration direction: +1 or -1.
    t : float
        Current time.
    y : ndarray
        Current state.
    t_old : float
        Previous time. None if no steps were made yet.
    nfev : int
        Number of evaluations of the right-hand side.
    njev : int
        Number of evaluations of the Jacobian.
