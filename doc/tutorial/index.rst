=======================================================================

.. topic:: Quick start

    In this section, we introduce the `machine learning 
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_
    vocabulary that we use through-out `scikit-learn` and give a 
    simple learning example.

.. note:: **Videos**

    Videos with tutorials can also be found in the :ref:`videos` section.

.. note:: **Doctest Mode**

   The code-examples in the above tutorials are written in a
   *python-console* format. If you wish to easily execute these examples
   in **iPython**, use::
   	
	%doctest_mode

   in the iPython-console. You can then simply copy and paste the examples 
   directly into iPython without having to worry about removing the **>>>** 
   manually.
