About us

History
=======

This project was started in 2007 as a Google Summer of Code project by
David Cournapeau. Later that year, Matthieu Brucher started working on this project
as part of his thesis.

In 2010 Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent
Michel of INRIA took leadership of the project and made the first public
release, February the 1st 2010. Since then, several releases have appeared
following an approximately 3-month cycle, and a thriving international
community has been leading the development. As a result, INRIA holds the
copyright over the work done by people who were employed by INRIA at the
time of the contribution.

Governance
==========

The decision making process and governance structure of scikit-learn, like roles and responsibilities, is laid out in the :ref:`governance document <governance>`.
