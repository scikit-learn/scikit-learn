About us
========

History
=======

This project was started in 2007 as a Google Summer of Code project by
David Cournapeau. Later that year, Matthieu Brucher started working on this project 
as part of his thesis.

In 2010 Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent
Michel of INRIA took leadership of the project and made the first public
release, February the 1st 2010. Since then, several releases have appeared
following an approximately 3-month cycle, and a thriving international
community has been leading the development. As a result, INRIA holds the
copyright over the work done by people who were employed by INRIA at the
time of the contribution.

Governance
==========

The decision making process and governance structure of scikit-learn, like roles and responsibilities, is laid out in the :ref:`governance document <governance>`.

Coding Sprints
==============

The scikit-learn project has a long history of `open source coding sprints
<https://blog.scikit-learn.org/events/sprints-value/>`_ with over 50 sprint
events from 2010 to present day. There are scores of sponsors who contributed
to costs which include venue, food, travel, developer time and more. See
`scikit-learn sprints <https://blog.scikit-learn.org/sprints/>`_ for a full
list of events.

Donating to the project
=======================

If you are interested in donating to the project or to one of our code-sprints,
please donate via the `NumFOCUS Donations Page
<https://numfocus.org/donate-to-scikit-learn>`_.

.. raw:: html

  <p class="text-center">
    <a class="btn sk-btn-orange mb-1" href="https://numfocus.org/donate-to-scikit-learn">
      Help us, <strong>donate!</strong>
    </a>
  </p>

All donations will be handled by `NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org/>`_, a non-profit
organization which is managed by a board of `Scipy community members
<https://numfocus.org/board.html>`_. NumFOCUS's mission is to foster scientific
computing software, in particular in Python. As a fiscal home of scikit-learn, it
ensures that money is available when needed to keep the project funded and available
while in compliance with tax regulations.

The received donations for the scikit-learn project mostly will go towards covering
travel-expenses for code sprints, as well as towards the organization budget of the
project [#f1]_.

.. rubric:: Notes

.. [#f1] Regarding the organization budget, in particular, we might use some of
  the donated funds to pay for other project expenses such as DNS,
  hosting or continuous integration services.


Infrastructure support
======================

We would also like to thank `Microsoft Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/>`_,
`Cirrus Cl <https://cirrus-ci.org>`_, `CircleCl <https://circleci.com/>`_ for free CPU
time on their Continuous Integration servers, and `Anaconda Inc. <https://www.anaconda.com>`_
for the storage they provide for our staging and nightly builds.
