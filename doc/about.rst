About us
========

History
-------

This project was started in 2007 as a Google Summer of Code project by
David Cournapeau. Later that year, Matthieu Brucher started work on
this project as part of his thesis.

In 2010 Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent
Michel of INRIA took leadership of the project and made the first public
release, February the 1st 2010. Since then, several releases have appeared
following a ~ 3-month cycle, and a thriving international community has
been leading the development.

Donating to the project
.......................

If you are interested in donating to the project or to one of our code-sprints,
you can use the *Paypal* button below or the `NumFOCUS Donations Page
<https://www.numfocus.org/support-numfocus.html>`_ (if you use the latter,
please indicate that you are donating for the scikit-learn project).

All donations will be handled by `NumFOCUS
<https://numfocus.org/>`_, a non-profit-organization which is
managed by a board of `Scipy community members
<https://numfocus.org/board.html>`_. NumFOCUS's mission is to foster
scientific computing software, in particular in Python. As a fiscal home
of scikit-learn, it ensures that money is available when needed to keep
the project funded and available while in compliance with tax regulations.

The received donations for the scikit-learn project mostly will go towards
covering travel-expenses for code sprints, as well as towards the organization
budget of the project [#f1]_.

.. [#f1] Regarding the organization budget, in particular, we might use some of
         the donated funds to pay for other project expenses such as DNS,
         hosting or continuous integration services.

Infrastructure support
----------------------

- We would also like to thank `Microsoft Azure
  <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/>`_, `Travis Cl <https://travis-ci.org/>`_,
  `CircleCl <https://circleci.com/>`_ for free CPU time on their Continuous
  Integration servers, and `Anaconda Inc. <https://www.anaconda.com>`_ for the
  storage they provide for our staging and nightly builds.
