Toy datasets
============

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.datasets

scikit-learn comes with a few small standard datasets that do not require to
download any file from some external website.

They can be loaded using the following functions:

.. autosummary::

   load_iris
   load_diabetes
   load_digits
   load_linnerud
   load_wine
   load_breast_cancer

These datasets are useful to quickly illustrate the behavior of the
various algorithms implemented in scikit-learn. They are however often too
small to be representative of real world machine learning tasks.
