Documentation for scikit-learn
-------------------------------

This section contains the full manual and web page as displayed in
http://scikit-learn.sf.net. To generate the full web page, including
the example gallery (this might take a while):

    make html

Or, if you'd rather not build the example gallery:

    make html-noplot

That should create all the doc in directory _build/html

To build the PDF manual, run

    make latexpdf


Upload the generated doc to sourceforge
---------------------------------------

First of, generate the html documentation::

    make html

This should create a directory _build/html with the documentation in html
format.


Now can upload the generated HTML documentation using scp or some other SFTP
clients.
