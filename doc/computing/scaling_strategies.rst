Strategies to scale computationally: bigger data
=================================================

For some applications the amount of examples, features (or both) and/or the
speed at which they need to be processed are challenging for traditional
approaches. In these cases scikit-learn has a number of options you can
consider to make your system scale.

Scaling with instances using out-of-core learning
--------------------------------------------------

Out-of-core (or "external memory") learning is a technique used to learn from
data that cannot fit in a computer's main memory (RAM).

Here is a sketch of a system designed to achieve this goal:

1. a way to stream instances
2. a way to extract features from instances
3. an incremental algorithm

Streaming instances
....................

Basically, 1. may be a reader that yields instances from files on a
hard drive, a database, from a network stream etc. However,
details on how to achieve this are beyond the scope of this documentation.

Extracting features
...................

\2. could be any relevant way to extract features among the
different :ref:`feature extraction <feature_extraction>` methods supported by
scikit-learn. However, when working with data that needs vectorization and
where the set of features or values is not known in advance one should take
explicit care. A good example is text classification where unknown terms are
likely to be found during training. It is possible to use a stateful
vectorizer if making multiple passes over the data is reasonable from an
application point of view. Otherwise, one can turn up the difficulty by using
a stateless feature extractor. Currently the preferred way to do this is to
use the so-called :ref:`hashing trick<feature_hashing>` as implemented by
:class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher` for datasets with categorical
variables represented as list of Python dicts or
:class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer` for text documents.

Incremental learning
.....................

Finally, for 3. we have a number of options inside scikit-learn. Although not
all algorithms can learn incrementally (i.e. without seeing all the instances
at once), all estimators implementing the ``partial_fit`` API are candidates.
Actually, the ability to learn incrementally from a mini-batch of instances
(sometimes called "online learning") is key to out-of-core learning as it
guarantees that at any given time there will be only a small amount of
instances in the main memory. Choosing a good size for the mini-batch that
balances relevancy and memory footprint could involve some tuning [1]_.

Here is a list of incremental estimators for different tasks:

- Classification
    + :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB`
    + :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB`
    + :class:`sklearn.linear_model.Perceptron`
    + :class:`sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier`
    + :class:`sklearn.linear_model.PassiveAggressiveClassifier`
    + :class:`sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier`
- Regression
    + :class:`sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor`
    + :class:`sklearn.linear_model.PassiveAggressiveRegressor`
    + :class:`sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor`
- Clustering
    + :class:`sklearn.cluster.MiniBatchKMeans`
    + :class:`sklearn.cluster.Birch`
- Decomposition / feature Extraction
    + :class:`sklearn.decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning`
    + :class:`sklearn.decomposition.IncrementalPCA`
    + :class:`sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation`
    + :class:`sklearn.decomposition.MiniBatchNMF`
- Preprocessing
    + :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`
    + :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`
    + :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.MaxAbsScaler`

For classification, a somewhat important thing to note is that although a
stateless feature extraction routine may be able to cope with new/unseen
attributes, the incremental learner itself may be unable to cope with
new/unseen targets classes. In this case you have to pass all the possible
classes to the first ``partial_fit`` call using the ``classes=`` parameter.

Another aspect to consider when choosing a proper algorithm is that not all of
them put the same importance on each example over time. Namely, the
``Perceptron`` is still sensitive to badly labeled examples even after many
examples whereas the ``SGD*`` and ``PassiveAggressive*`` families are more
robust to this kind of artifacts. Conversely, the latter also tend to give less
importance to remarkably different, yet properly labeled examples when they
come late in the stream as their learning rate decreases over time.

Examples
..........

Finally, we have a full-fledged example of
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_applications_plot_out_of_core_classification.py`. It is aimed at
providing a starting point for people wanting to build out-of-core learning
systems and demonstrates most of the notions discussed above.

Furthermore, it also shows the evolution of the performance of different
algorithms with the number of processed examples.

    :target: ../auto_examples/applications/plot_out_of_core_classification.html
    :scale: 80

.. centered:: |accuracy_over_time|

Now looking at the computation time of the different parts, we see that the
vectorization is much more expensive than learning itself. From the different
algorithms, ``MultinomialNB`` is the most expensive, but its overhead can be
mitigated by increasing the size of the mini-batches (exercise: change
``minibatch_size`` to 100 and 10000 in the program and compare).

Notes
......

.. [1] Depending on the algorithm the mini-batch size can influence results or
       not. SGD*, PassiveAggressive*, and discrete NaiveBayes are truly online
       and are not affected by batch size. Conversely, MiniBatchKMeans
       convergence rate is affected by the batch size. Also, its memory
       footprint can vary dramatically with batch size.
