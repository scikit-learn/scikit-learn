- `Introduction to scikit-learn
  <http://videolectures.net/icml2010_varaquaux_scik/>`_ by `Gael Varoquaux`_ at
  ICML 2010

    A three minute video from a very early stage of the scikit, explaining the
    basic idea and approach we are following.

- `Introduction to statistical learning with scikit
  learn <http://archive.org/search.php?query=scikit-learn>`_ by
  `Gael Varoquaux`_ at SciPy 2011

    An extensive tutorial, consisting of four sessions of one hour.
    The tutorial covers basics of machine learning,
    many algorithms and how to apply them using scikit-learn. The
    material corresponding is now in the scikit-learn documentation
    section :ref:`stat_learn_tut_index`.

  by `Olivier Grisel`_ at PyCon 2011

    Thirty minute introduction to text classification. Explains how to
    use NLTK and scikit-learn to solve real-world text classification
    tasks and compares against cloud-based solutions.
