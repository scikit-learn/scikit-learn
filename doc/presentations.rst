The Official scikit-learn MOOC
==============================

If you are new to scikit-learn, or looking to strengthen your understanding,
we highly recommend the **scikit-learn MOOC (Massive Open Online Course)**.

The MOOC, created and maintained by some of the scikit-learn core-contributors,
is **free of charge** and is designed to help learners of all levels master
machine learning using scikit-learn. It covers topics
from the fundamental machine learning concepts to more advanced areas like
predictive modeling pipelines and model evaluation.

The course materials are available at:

`<https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/>`_.

This course is also hosted on the `FUN platform
<https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/>`_,
which additionally makes the content interactive without installation, and gives
access to a discussion forum.

The videos are available as a YouTube playlist on the
`Inria Learning Lab channel <https://www.youtube.com/@inrialearninglab>`_:

New to Scientific Python?
==========================
For those that are still new to the scientific Python ecosystem, we highly
recommend the `Python Scientific Lecture Notes
<https://scipy-lectures.org>`_. This will help you find your footing a
bit and will definitely improve your scikit-learn experience.  A basic
understanding of NumPy arrays is recommended to make the most of scikit-learn.

External Tutorials
===================

There are several online tutorials available which are geared toward
specific subject areas:

- `Machine Learning for NeuroImaging in Python <https://nilearn.github.io/>`_
- `Machine Learning for Astronomical Data Analysis <https://github.com/astroML/sklearn_tutorial>`_
