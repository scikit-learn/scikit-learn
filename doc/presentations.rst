New to Scientific Python?
==========================
For those that are still new to the scientific Python ecosystem, we highly
recommend the `Python Scientific Lecture Notes
<https://scipy-lectures.org>`_. This will help you find your footing a
bit and will definitely improve your scikit-learn experience.  A basic
understanding of NumPy arrays is recommended to make the most of scikit-learn.

External Tutorials
===================

There are several online tutorials available which are geared toward
specific subject areas:

- `Machine Learning for NeuroImaging in Python <https://nilearn.github.io/>`_
- `Machine Learning for Astronomical Data Analysis <https://github.com/astroML/sklearn_tutorial>`_
