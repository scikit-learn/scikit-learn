How to optimize for speed
=========================

The following gives some practical guidelines to help you write efficient
code for the scikit-learn project.

.. note::

  While it is always useful to profile your code so as to **check
  performance assumptions**, it is also highly recommended
  to **review the literature** to ensure that the implemented algorithm
  is the state of the art for the task before investing into costly
  implementation optimization.

  Times and times, hours of efforts invested in optimizing complicated
  implementation details have been rendered irrelevant by the subsequent
  discovery of simple **algorithmic tricks**, or by using another algorithm
  altogether that is better suited to the problem.

  The section :ref:`warm-restarts` gives an example of such a trick.


Python, Cython or C/C++?
========================

.. currentmodule:: sklearn

In general, the scikit-learn project emphasizes the **readability** of
the source code to make it easy for the project users to dive into the
source code so as to understand how the algorithm behaves on their data
but also for ease of maintainability (by the developers).

When implementing a new algorithm is thus recommended to **start
implementing it in Python using Numpy and Scipy** by taking care of avoiding
looping code using the vectorized idioms of those libraries. In practice
this means trying to **replace any nested for loops by calls to equivalent
Numpy array methods**. The goal is to avoid the CPU wasting time in the
Python interpreter rather than crunching numbers to fit your statistical
model. It's generally a good idea to consider NumPy and SciPy performance tips:
https://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/PerformanceTips

Sometimes however an algorithm cannot be expressed efficiently in simple
vectorized Numpy code. In this case, the recommended strategy is the
following:

1. **Profile** the Python implementation to find the main bottleneck and
   isolate it in a **dedicated module level function**. This function
   will be reimplemented as a compiled extension module.

2. If there exists a well maintained BSD or MIT **C/C++** implementation
   of the same algorithm that is not too big, you can write a
   **Cython wrapper** for it and include a copy of the source code
   of the library in the scikit-learn source tree: this strategy is
   used for the classes :class:`svm.LinearSVC`, :class:`svm.SVC` and
   :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` (wrappers for liblinear
   and libsvm).

3. Otherwise, write an optimized version of your Python function using
   **Cython** directly. This strategy is used
   for the :class:`linear_model.ElasticNet` and
   :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` classes for instance.

4. **Move the Python version of the function in the tests** and use
   it to check that the results of the compiled extension are consistent
   with the gold standard, easy to debug Python version.

5. Once the code is optimized (not simple bottleneck spottable by
   profiling), check whether it is possible to have **coarse grained
   parallelism** that is amenable to **multi-processing** by using the
   ``joblib.Parallel`` class.

.. _profiling-python-code:

Profiling Python code
=====================

In order to profile Python code we recommend to write a script that
loads and prepare you data and then use the IPython integrated profiler
for interactively exploring the relevant part for the code.

Suppose we want to profile the Non Negative Matrix Factorization module
of scikit-learn. Let us setup a new IPython session and load the digits
dataset and as in the :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_classification_plot_digits_classification.py` example::

  In [1]: from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

  In [2]: from sklearn.datasets import load_digits

  In [3]: X, _ = load_digits(return_X_y=True)

Before starting the profiling session and engaging in tentative
optimization iterations, it is important to measure the total execution
time of the function we want to optimize without any kind of profiler
overhead and save it somewhere for later reference::

  In [4]: %timeit NMF(n_components=16, tol=1e-2).fit(X)
  1 loops, best of 3: 1.7 s per loop

To have a look at the overall performance profile using the ``%prun``
magic command::

  In [5]: %prun -l nmf.py NMF(n_components=16, tol=1e-2).fit(X)
           14496 function calls in 1.682 CPU seconds

     Ordered by: internal time
     List reduced from 90 to 9 due to restriction <'nmf.py'>

          1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 nmf.py:337(__init__)
          1    0.000    0.000    1.681    1.681 nmf.py:461(fit)

The ``tottime`` column is the most interesting: it gives to total time spent
executing the code of a given function ignoring the time spent in executing the
sub-functions. The real total time (local code + sub-function calls) is given by
the ``cumtime`` column.

Note the use of the ``-l nmf.py`` that restricts the output to lines that
contains the "nmf.py" string. This is useful to have a quick look at the hotspot
of the nmf Python module it-self ignoring anything else.

Here is the beginning of the output of the same command without the ``-l nmf.py``
filter::

  In [5] %prun NMF(n_components=16, tol=1e-2).fit(X)
           16159 function calls in 1.840 CPU seconds

     Ordered by: internal time

  ...

The above results show that the execution is largely dominated by
dot products operations (delegated to blas). Hence there is probably
no huge gain to expect by rewriting this code in Cython or C/C++: in
this case out of the 1.7s total execution time, almost 0.7s are spent
in compiled code we can consider optimal. By rewriting the rest of the
Python code and assuming we could achieve a 1000% boost on this portion
(which is highly unlikely given the shallowness of the Python loops),
we would not gain more than a 2.4x speed-up globally.

Hence major improvements can only be achieved by **algorithmic
improvements** in this particular example (e.g. trying to find operation
that are both costly and useless to avoid computing then rather than
trying to optimize their implementation).

It is however still interesting to check what's happening inside the
``_nls_subproblem`` function which is the hotspot if we only consider
Python code: it takes around 100% of the accumulated time of the module. In
order to better understand the profile of this specific function, let
us install ``line_profiler`` and wire it to IPython:

.. prompt:: bash $

  pip install line_profiler

**Under IPython 0.13+**, first create a configuration profile:

.. prompt:: bash $

  ipython profile create

Then register the line_profiler extension in
``~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py``::

    c.TerminalIPythonApp.extensions.append('line_profiler')
    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions.append('line_profiler')

This will register the ``%lprun`` magic command in the IPython terminal application and the other frontends such as qtconsole and notebook.

Now restart IPython and let us use this new toy::

  In [1]: from sklearn.datasets import load_digits

  In [2]: from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
    ... : from sklearn.decomposition._nmf import _nls_subproblem

  In [3]: X, _ = load_digits(return_X_y=True)

  In [4]: %lprun -f _nls_subproblem NMF(n_components=16, tol=1e-2).fit(X)

     ...

By looking at the top values of the ``% Time`` column it is really easy to
pin-point the most expensive expressions that would deserve additional care.


Memory usage profiling
======================

You can analyze in detail the memory usage of any Python code with the help of
`memory_profiler <https://pypi.org/project/memory_profiler/>`_. First,
install the latest version:

.. prompt:: bash $

  pip install -U memory_profiler

Then, setup the magics in a manner similar to ``line_profiler``.

**Under IPython 0.11+**, first create a configuration profile:

.. prompt:: bash $

    ipython profile create


Then register the extension in
``~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py``
alongside the line profiler::

    c.TerminalIPythonApp.extensions.append('memory_profiler')
    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions.append('memory_profiler')

This will register the ``%memit`` and ``%mprun`` magic commands in the
IPython terminal application and the other frontends such as qtconsole and   notebook.

``%mprun`` is useful to examine, line-by-line, the memory usage of key
functions in your program. It is very similar to ``%lprun``, discussed in the
previous section. For example, from the ``memory_profiler`` ``examples``
directory::

    In [1] from example import my_func

    In [2] %mprun -f my_func my_func()
    Filename: example.py

    Line #    Mem usage  Increment   Line Contents
    ==============================================
         3                           @profile
         4      5.97 MB    0.00 MB   def my_func():
         5     13.61 MB    7.64 MB       a = [1] * (10 ** 6)
         6    166.20 MB  152.59 MB       b = [2] * (2 * 10 ** 7)
         7     13.61 MB -152.59 MB       del b
         8     13.61 MB    0.00 MB       return a

Another useful magic that ``memory_profiler`` defines is ``%memit``, which is
analogous to ``%timeit``. It can be used as follows::

    In [1]: import numpy as np

    In [2]: %memit np.zeros(1e7)
    maximum of 3: 76.402344 MB per loop

For more details, see the docstrings of the magics, using ``%memit?`` and
``%mprun?``.


Using Cython
============

If profiling of the Python code reveals that the Python interpreter
overhead is larger by one order of magnitude or more than the cost of the
actual numerical computation (e.g. ``for`` loops over vector components,
nested evaluation of conditional expression, scalar arithmetic...), it
is probably adequate to extract the hotspot portion of the code as a
standalone function in a ``.pyx`` file, add static type declarations and
then use Cython to generate a C program suitable to be compiled as a
Python extension module.

The `Cython's documentation <http://docs.cython.org/>`_ contains a tutorial and
reference guide for developing such a module.
For more information about developing in Cython for scikit-learn, see :ref:`cython`.


.. _profiling-compiled-extension:

Profiling compiled extensions
=============================

When working with compiled extensions (written in C/C++ with a wrapper or
directly as Cython extension), the default Python profiler is useless:
we need a dedicated tool to introspect what's happening inside the
compiled extension it-self.

Using yep and gperftools
------------------------

Easy profiling without special compilation options use yep:

- https://pypi.org/project/yep/
- https://fa.bianp.net/blog/2011/a-profiler-for-python-extensions

Using a debugger, gdb
---------------------

* It is helpful to use ``gdb`` to debug. In order to do so, one must use
  a Python interpreter built with debug support (debug symbols and proper
  optimization). To create a new conda environment (which you might need
  to deactivate and reactivate after building/installing) with a source-built
  CPython interpreter:

  .. code-block:: bash

         git clone https://github.com/python/cpython.git
         conda create -n debug-scikit-dev
         conda activate debug-scikit-dev
         cd cpython
         mkdir debug
         cd debug
         ../configure --prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX --with-pydebug
         make EXTRA_CFLAGS='-DPy_DEBUG' -j<num_cores>
         make install


Using gprof
-----------

In order to profile compiled Python extensions one could use ``gprof``
after having recompiled the project with ``gcc -pg`` and using the
``python-dbg`` variant of the interpreter on debian / ubuntu: however
this approach requires to also have ``numpy`` and ``scipy`` recompiled
with ``-pg`` which is rather complicated to get working.

Fortunately there exist two alternative profilers that don't require you to
recompile everything.

Using valgrind / callgrind / kcachegrind
----------------------------------------

kcachegrind
~~~~~~~~~~~

``yep`` can be used to create a profiling report.
``kcachegrind`` provides a graphical environment to visualize this report:

.. prompt:: bash $

  # Run yep to profile some python script
  python -m yep -c my_file.py

.. prompt:: bash $

  # open my_file.py.callgrin with kcachegrind
  kcachegrind my_file.py.prof

.. note::

   ``yep`` can be executed with the argument ``--lines`` or ``-l`` to compile
   a profiling report 'line by line'.

Multi-core parallelism using ``joblib.Parallel``
================================================

See `joblib documentation <https://joblib.readthedocs.io>`_


.. _warm-restarts:

A simple algorithmic trick: warm restarts
=========================================

See the glossary entry for :term:`warm_start`
