.. currentmodule:: sklearn.mixture

`sklearn.mixture` is a package which enables one to learn
Gaussian Mixture Models (diagonal, spherical, tied and full covariance
matrices supported), sample them, and estimate them from
data. Facilities to help determine the appropriate number of
components are also provided.

   **Two-component Gaussian mixture model:** *data points, and equi-probability surfaces of 
   the model.*

A Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the
data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of
Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. One can think of
mixture models as generalizing k-means clustering to incorporate
information about the covariance structure of the data as well as the
centers of the latent Gaussians.

Unfortunately, fitting the best mixture of Gaussians possible on a
given dataset (as measured by the likelihood criterion) is exponential
in the assumed number of latent gaussian distributions. For this
reason most of the time one uses approximate inference techniques in
these models that, while not guaranteed to return the optimal
solution, do converge quickly to a local optimum. To improve the
quality it is usual to fit these models many times with different
parameters and choose the best result, as measured by the likelihood
or some other external criterion. Here in `scikit-learn` we implement
two approximate inference algorithms for mixtures of gaussians:
expectation-maximization and variational inference. We also implement
a variant of the mixture model, known as the Dirichlet Process prior,
that doesn't need cross-validation procedures to choose the number of
components, and at the expense of extra computational time the user
only needs to specify a loose upper bound on this number and a
concentration parameter.

Expectation-maximization
------------------------

The main difficulty in learning gaussian mixture models from unlabeled
data is that it is one usually doesn't know which points came from
which latent mixtures (if one has access to this information it gets
very easy to fit a separate gaussian distribution to each set of
points). Expectation-maximization is a well-fundamented statistical
algorithm to get around this problem by an iterative process. First
one assumes random components (randomly centered on data points,
learned from k-means, or even just normally distributed around the
origin) and computes for each point a probability distribution on the
components it could have been assigned to. Then, one tweaks the
parameters to maximize the likelihood of the data given those
assignments. Repeating this process is guaranteed to always converge
to a local optimum. In the `scikit-learn` this algorithm in
implemented in the :class:`GMM` class.

Advantages of expectation-maximization:

:Speed: it is the fastest algorithm for learning mixture models

:Agnostic: as this algorithm maximizes only the likelihood, it
   will not bias the means towards zero, or bias the cluster sizes to
   have specific structures that might or might not apply.

Disadvantages of expectation-maximization:

:Singularities: when one has insufficiently many points per
   mixture, estimating the covariance matrices becomes difficult,
   and the algorithm is known to diverge and find solutions with
   infinite likelihood unless one regularizes the covariances artificially.

:Number of components: this algorithm will always use all the
   components it has access to, needing complex held-out data
   criteria to decide how many components to use in the absence of
   external cues.

Variational inference
---------------------

Variational inference is a more advanced extension to
expectation-maximization that instead of maximizing the likelihood
approximates full bayesian integration of the latent parameters. The
principle behind variational methods is the same as
expectation-maximization (that is both are iterative algorithms that
alternate between finding the posterior probabilities for each point
to be generated by each mixture and fitting the mixtures to these
assigned points), but variational methods add regularization by
integrating information from prior distributions. This avoids the
singularities often found in expectation-maximization solutions but
introduces some subtle biases to the model. Inference is often notably
slower, but not usually as much so as to render usage unpractical.

Due to its bayesian nature, the variational algorithm needs more
hyperparameters than expectation-maximization, but the only actually
important of these is the concentration parameter `alpha`. Specifying
a high value of alpha leads more often to uniformly-sized mixture
components, while specifying small (between 0 and 1) values will lead
to some mixture components getting almost all the points while most
mixture components will be centered on just a few of the remaining
points.

Simply switching from expectation-maximization to variational
inference has the main following advantage:

:Regularization: due to the incorporation of prior information,
   variational solutions have less pathological special cases than
   expectation-maximization solutions. One can then use full
   covariance matrices in high dimensions or in cases where some
   components might be centered around a single point without
   risking divergence.

But brings with it the following disadvantage:

:Bias: to regularize a model one has to add biases. The
   variational algorithm will bias all the means towards the origin
   (part of the prior information adds a "ghost point" in the origin
   to every mixture component) and it will bias the covariances to
   be more spherical. It will also, depending on the concentration
   parameter, bias the cluster structure either towards uniformity
   or towards a rich-get-richer scenario.

:Hyperparameters: this algorithm needs an extra hyperparameter
   that might need experimental tuning via cross-validation.


.. _dirichlet_process:

The Dirichlet Process
---------------------

Here we will talk only about using variational inference algorithms on
dirichlet process mixtures, for reasons of simplicity.

One of the main advantages of variational techniques is that they can
incorporate prior information to the model in many different ways. The
dirichlet process is a prior probability distribution on *clusterings
with an infinite, unbounded, number of partitions*. Variational
techniques let us incorporate this prior structure on gaussian mixture
models at almost no penalty in inference time, comparing with a finite
gaussian mixture model.

An important question is how can the dirichlet process use an
infinite, unbounded number of clusters and still be consistent. While
a full explanation doesn't fit this manual, one can think of its
chinese restaurant process analogy to help understanding it. The
chinese restaurant process is a generative story for the dirichlet
process. Imagine a chinese restaurant with an infinite number of
tables, at first all empty. When the first customer of the day
arrives, he sits at the first table. Every following customer will
then either sit on an occupied table with probability proportional to
the number of customers in that table or sit in an entirely new table
with probability proportional to the concentration parameter
`alpha`. After a finite number of customers has sat, it is easy to see
that only finitely many of the infinite tables will ever be used, and
the higher the value of alpha the more total tables will be used. So
the dirichlet process does clustering with an unbounded number of
mixture components by assuming a very assymmetrical prior structure
over the assignments of points to components that is very concentrated
(this property is known as rich-get-richer, as the full tables in the
chinese restaurant process only tend to get fuller as the simulation
progresses).

Variational inference techniques for the dirichlet process still work
with a finite approximation to this infinite mixture model, but
instead of having to specify a priori how many components one wants to
use, one just specifies the concentration parameter and an upper bound
on the number of mixture components (this upper bound, assuming it is
higher than the "true" number of components, affects only algorithmic
complexity, not the actual number of components used).

The advantages of using a dirichlet process mixture model are:

:Less sensitivity to the number of parameters: unlike finite
   models, which will almost always use all components as much as
   they can, and hence will produce wildly different solutions for
   different numbers of components, the dirichlet process solution
   won't change much with changes to the parameters, leading to more
   stability and less tuning.
   
:No need to specify the number of components:

:Implicit strong regularization: when learning finite mixtures
   with expectation-maximization or variational inference it might
   be that the structure found during learning will not fit held-out
   data very well (specially when using bad parameters). As the
   dirichlet process automatically performs model selection it tends
   to fit structures that generalize better to unseen data.

The main disadvantages of using the dirichlet process are:

:Speed: the extra parametrization necessary for variational
   inference and for the structure of the dirichlet process can and
   will make inference slower, although not by much.

:Bias: as in variational techniques, but only more so, there are
   many implicit biases in the dirichlet process and the inference
   algorithms, and whenever there is a mismatch between these biases
   and the data it might be possible to fit better models using a
   finite mixture.
    
GMM classifier
==============

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.mixture

The :class:`GMM` object implements the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm for fitting mixture-of-gaussian models. It can also draw
confidence ellipsoides for multivariate models, and compute the
Bayesian Information Criterion to assess the number of clusters in the
data. A :meth:`GMM.fit` method is provided that learns a Gaussian
Mixture Model from train data. Given test data, it can assign to each
sample the class of the Gaussian it mostly probably belong to using
the :meth:`GMM.predict` method.

..  
    Alternatively, the probability of each
    sample beloning to the various Gaussians may be retrieved using the
    :meth:`GMM.predict_proba` method.

Variational Gaussian mixtures: VBGMM classifier
===============================================

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.mixture

The :class:`VBGMM` object implements a variant of the Gaussian mixture
model with variational inference algorithms. The API is identical to
:class:`GMM`. It is essentially a middle-ground between :class:`GMM`
and :class:`DPGMM`, as it has some of the properties of the dirichlet
process.


Infinite Gaussian mixtures: DPGMM classifier
=============================================

The :class:`DPGMM` object implements a variant of the Gaussian mixture
model with a variable (but bounded) number of components using the
Dirichlet Process. The API is identical to :class:`GMM`. 


.. figure:: ../auto_examples/mixture/images/plot_gmm_1.png

   :scale: 70%

The example above compares a Gaussian mixture model fitted with 5
components on a dataset, to a DPGMM model. We can see that the DPGMM is
able to limit itself to only 2 components. With very little observations,
the DPGMM can take a conservative stand, and fit only one component.
