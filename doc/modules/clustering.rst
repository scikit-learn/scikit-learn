Clustering
==========

`Clustering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis>`__ of
unlabeled data can be performed with the module :mod:`sklearn.cluster`.

Each clustering algorithm comes in two variants: a class, that implements
the ``fit`` method to learn the clusters on train data, and a function,
that, given train data, returns an array of integer labels corresponding
to the different clusters. For the class, the labels over the training
data can be found in the ``labels_`` attribute.

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.cluster

.. topic:: Input data

    One important thing to note is that the algorithms implemented in
    this module can take different kinds of matrix as input. All the
    methods accept standard data matrices of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``.
    These can be obtained from the classes in the :mod:`sklearn.feature_extraction`
    module. For :class:`AffinityPropagation`, :class:`SpectralClustering`
    and :class:`DBSCAN` one can also input similarity matrices of shape
    ``(n_samples, n_samples)``. These can be obtained from the functions
    in the :mod:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise` module.

Non-flat geometry clustering is useful when the clusters have a specific
shape, i.e. a non-flat manifold, and the standard euclidean distance is
not the right metric. This case arises in the two top rows of the figure
above.

Gaussian mixture models, useful for clustering, are described in
:ref:`another chapter of the documentation <mixture>` dedicated to
mixture models. KMeans can be seen as a special case of Gaussian mixture
model with equal covariance per component.

:term:`Transductive <transductive>` clustering methods (in contrast to
:term:`inductive` clustering methods) are not designed to be applied to new,
unseen data.

.. _k_means:

K-means
=======

The :class:`KMeans` algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n
groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the *inertia* or
within-cluster sum-of-squares (see below). This algorithm requires the number
of clusters to be specified. It scales well to large numbers of samples and has
been used across a large range of application areas in many different fields.

The k-means algorithm divides a set of :math:`N` samples :math:`X` into
:math:`K` disjoint clusters :math:`C`, each described by the mean :math:`\mu_j`
of the samples in the cluster. The means are commonly called the cluster
"centroids"; note that they are not, in general, points from :math:`X`,
although they live in the same space.

The K-means algorithm aims to choose centroids that minimise the **inertia**,
or **within-cluster sum-of-squares criterion**:

.. math:: \sum_{i=0}^{n}\min_{\mu_j \in C}(||x_i - \mu_j||^2)

Inertia can be recognized as a measure of how internally coherent clusters are.
It suffers from various drawbacks:

- Inertia makes the assumption that clusters are convex and isotropic,
  which is not always the case. It responds poorly to elongated clusters,
  or manifolds with irregular shapes.

- Inertia is not a normalized metric: we just know that lower values are
  better and zero is optimal. But in very high-dimensional spaces, Euclidean
  distances tend to become inflated
  (this is an instance of the so-called "curse of dimensionality").
  Running a dimensionality reduction algorithm such as :ref:`PCA` prior to
  k-means clustering can alleviate this problem and speed up the
  computations.

For more detailed descriptions of the issues shown above and how to address them,
refer to the examples :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_kmeans_assumptions.py`
and :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.py`.

K-means is often referred to as Lloyd's algorithm. In basic terms, the
algorithm has three steps. The first step chooses the initial centroids, with
the most basic method being to choose :math:`k` samples from the dataset
:math:`X`. After initialization, K-means consists of looping between the
two other steps. The first step assigns each sample to its nearest centroid.
The second step creates new centroids by taking the mean value of all of the
samples assigned to each previous centroid. The difference between the old
and the new centroids are computed and the algorithm repeats these last two
steps until this value is less than a threshold. In other words, it repeats
until the centroids do not move significantly.

.. image:: ../auto_examples/cluster/images/sphx_glr_plot_kmeans_digits_001.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_digits.html
   :align: right
   :scale: 35

K-means is equivalent to the expectation-maximization algorithm
with a small, all-equal, diagonal covariance matrix.

The algorithm can also be understood through the concept of `Voronoi diagrams
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram>`_. First the Voronoi diagram of
the points is calculated using the current centroids. Each segment in the
Voronoi diagram becomes a separate cluster. Secondly, the centroids are updated
to the mean of each segment. The algorithm then repeats this until a stopping
criterion is fulfilled. Usually, the algorithm stops when the relative decrease
in the objective function between iterations is less than the given tolerance
value. This is not the case in this implementation: iteration stops when
centroids move less than the tolerance.

Given enough time, K-means will always converge, however this may be to a local
minimum. This is highly dependent on the initialization of the centroids.
As a result, the computation is often done several times, with different
initializations of the centroids. One method to help address this issue is the
k-means++ initialization scheme, which has been implemented in scikit-learn
(use the ``init='k-means++'`` parameter). This initializes the centroids to be
(generally) distant from each other, leading to probably better results than
random initialization, as shown in the reference. For detailed examples of
comparing different initialization schemes, refer to
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_kmeans_digits.py` and
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_kmeans_stability_low_dim_dense.py`.

K-means++ can also be called independently to select seeds for other
clustering algorithms, see :func:`sklearn.cluster.kmeans_plusplus` for details
and example usage.

The algorithm supports sample weights, which can be given by a parameter
``sample_weight``. This allows to assign more weight to some samples when
computing cluster centers and values of inertia. For example, assigning a
weight of 2 to a sample is equivalent to adding a duplicate of that sample
to the dataset :math:`X`.

Low-level parallelism
---------------------

:class:`KMeans` benefits from OpenMP based parallelism through Cython. Small
chunks of data (256 samples) are processed in parallel, which in addition
yields a low memory footprint. For more details on how to control the number of
threads, please refer to our :ref:`parallelism` notes.

.. _mini_batch_kmeans:

Mini Batch K-Means
------------------

The :class:`MiniBatchKMeans` is a variant of the :class:`KMeans` algorithm
which uses mini-batches to reduce the computation time, while still attempting
to optimise the same objective function. Mini-batches are subsets of the input
data, randomly sampled in each training iteration. These mini-batches
drastically reduce the amount of computation required to converge to a local
solution. In contrast to other algorithms that reduce the convergence time of
k-means, mini-batch k-means produces results that are generally only slightly
worse than the standard algorithm.

The algorithm iterates between two major steps, similar to vanilla k-means.
In the first step, :math:`b` samples are drawn randomly from the dataset, to form
a mini-batch. These are then assigned to the nearest centroid. In the second
step, the centroids are updated. In contrast to k-means, this is done on a
per-sample basis. For each sample in the mini-batch, the assigned centroid
is updated by taking the streaming average of the sample and all previous
samples assigned to that centroid. This has the effect of decreasing the
rate of change for a centroid over time. These steps are performed until
convergence or a predetermined number of iterations is reached.

:class:`MiniBatchKMeans` converges faster than :class:`KMeans`, but the quality
of the results is reduced. In practice this difference in quality can be quite
small, as shown in the example and cited reference.

.. _affinity_propagation:

Affinity Propagation
====================

:class:`AffinityPropagation` creates clusters by sending messages between
pairs of samples until convergence. A dataset is then described using a small
number of exemplars, which are identified as those most representative of other
samples. The messages sent between pairs represent the suitability for one
sample to be the exemplar of the other, which is updated in response to the
values from other pairs. This updating happens iteratively until convergence,
at which point the final exemplars are chosen, and hence the final clustering
is given.

.. figure:: ../auto_examples/cluster/images/sphx_glr_plot_affinity_propagation_001.png
   :target: ../auto_examples/cluster/plot_affinity_propagation.html
   :align: center
   :scale: 50


Affinity Propagation can be interesting as it chooses the number of
clusters based on the data provided. For this purpose, the two important
parameters are the *preference*, which controls how many exemplars are
used, and the *damping factor* which damps the responsibility and
availability messages to avoid numerical oscillations when updating these
messages.

The main drawback of Affinity Propagation is its complexity. The
algorithm has a time complexity of the order :math:`O(N^2 T)`, where :math:`N`
is the number of samples and :math:`T` is the number of iterations until
convergence. Further, the memory complexity is of the order
:math:`O(N^2)` if a dense similarity matrix is used, but reducible if a
sparse similarity matrix is used. This makes Affinity Propagation most
appropriate for small to medium sized datasets.

.. dropdown:: Algorithm description

  The messages sent between points belong to one of two categories. The first is
  the responsibility :math:`r(i, k)`, which is the accumulated evidence that
  sample :math:`k` should be the exemplar for sample :math:`i`. The second is the
  availability :math:`a(i, k)` which is the accumulated evidence that sample
  :math:`i` should choose sample :math:`k` to be its exemplar, and considers the
  values for all other samples that :math:`k` should be an exemplar. In this way,
  exemplars are chosen by samples if they are (1) similar enough to many samples
  and (2) chosen by many samples to be representative of themselves.

  More formally, the responsibility of a sample :math:`k` to be the exemplar of
  sample :math:`i` is given by:

  .. math::

      r(i, k) \leftarrow s(i, k) - max [ a(i, k') + s(i, k') \forall k' \neq k ]

  Where :math:`s(i, k)` is the similarity between samples :math:`i` and :math:`k`.
  The availability of sample :math:`k` to be the exemplar of sample :math:`i` is
  given by:

  .. math::

      a(i, k) \leftarrow min [0, r(k, k) + \sum_{i'~s.t.~i' \notin \{i, k\}}{r(i',
      k)}]

  To begin with, all values for :math:`r` and :math:`a` are set to zero, and the
  calculation of each iterates until convergence. As discussed above, in order to
  avoid numerical oscillations when updating the messages, the damping factor
  :math:`\lambda` is introduced to iteration process:

  .. math:: r_{t+1}(i, k) = \lambda\cdot r_{t}(i, k) + (1-\lambda)\cdot r_{t+1}(i, k)
  .. math:: a_{t+1}(i, k) = \lambda\cdot a_{t}(i, k) + (1-\lambda)\cdot a_{t+1}(i, k)

  where :math:`t` indicates the iteration times.

.. _mean_shift:

Mean Shift
==========
:class:`MeanShift` clustering aims to discover *blobs* in a smooth density of
samples. It is a centroid based algorithm, which works by updating candidates
for centroids to be the mean of the points within a given region. These
candidates are then filtered in a post-processing stage to eliminate
near-duplicates to form the final set of centroids.

.. dropdown:: Mathematical details

  The position of centroid candidates is iteratively adjusted using a technique
  called hill climbing, which finds local maxima of the estimated probability
  density. Given a candidate centroid :math:`x` for iteration :math:`t`, the
  candidate is updated according to the following equation:

  .. math::

      x^{t+1} = x^t + m(x^t)

  Where :math:`m` is the *mean shift* vector that is computed for each centroid
  that points towards a region of the maximum increase in the density of points.
  To compute :math:`m` we define :math:`N(x)` as the neighborhood of samples
  within a given distance around :math:`x`. Then :math:`m` is computed using the
  following equation, effectively updating a centroid to be the mean of the
  samples within its neighborhood:

  .. math::

      m(x) = \frac{1}{|N(x)|} \sum_{x_j \in N(x)}x_j - x

  In general, the equation for :math:`m` depends on a kernel used for density
  estimation. The generic formula is:

  .. math::

      m(x) = \frac{\sum_{x_j \in N(x)}K(x_j - x)x_j}{\sum_{x_j \in N(x)}K(x_j -
      x)} - x

  In our implementation, :math:`K(x)` is equal to 1 if :math:`x` is small enough
  and is equal to 0 otherwise. Effectively :math:`K(y - x)` indicates whether
  :math:`y` is in the neighborhood of :math:`x`.


The algorithm automatically sets the number of clusters, instead of relying on a
parameter ``bandwidth``, which dictates the size of the region to search through.
This parameter can be set manually, but can be estimated using the provided
``estimate_bandwidth`` function, which is called if the bandwidth is not set.

The algorithm is not highly scalable, as it requires multiple nearest neighbor
searches during the execution of the algorithm. The algorithm is guaranteed to
converge, however the algorithm will stop iterating when the change in centroids
is small.

Labelling a new sample is performed by finding the nearest centroid for a
given sample.

.. _spectral_clustering:

Spectral clustering
===================

:class:`SpectralClustering` performs a low-dimension embedding of the
affinity matrix between samples, followed by clustering, e.g., by KMeans,
of the components of the eigenvectors in the low dimensional space.
It is especially computationally efficient if the affinity matrix is sparse
and the `amg` solver is used for the eigenvalue problem (Note, the `amg` solver
requires that the `pyamg <https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg>`_ module is installed.)

The present version of SpectralClustering requires the number of clusters
to be specified in advance. It works well for a small number of clusters,
but is not advised for many clusters.

For two clusters, SpectralClustering solves a convex relaxation of the
`normalized cuts <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/papers/SM-ncut.pdf>`_
problem on the similarity graph: cutting the graph in two so that the weight of
the edges cut is small compared to the weights of the edges inside each
cluster. This criteria is especially interesting when working on images, where
graph vertices are pixels, and weights of the edges of the similarity graph are
computed using a function of a gradient of the image.

.. warning:: Transforming distance to well-behaved similarities

    Note that if the values of your similarity matrix are not well
    distributed, e.g. with negative values or with a distance matrix
    rather than a similarity, the spectral problem will be singular and
    the problem not solvable. In which case it is advised to apply a
    transformation to the entries of the matrix. For instance, in the
    case of a signed distance matrix, is common to apply a heat kernel::

        similarity = np.exp(-beta * distance / distance.std())

    See the examples for such an application.

Different label assignment strategies
-------------------------------------

Different label assignment strategies can be used, corresponding to the
``assign_labels`` parameter of :class:`SpectralClustering`.
``"kmeans"`` strategy can match finer details, but can be unstable.
In particular, unless you control the ``random_state``, it may not be
reproducible from run-to-run, as it depends on random initialization.
The alternative ``"discretize"`` strategy is 100% reproducible, but tends
to create parcels of fairly even and geometrical shape.
The recently added ``"cluster_qr"`` option is a deterministic alternative that
tends to create the visually best partitioning on the example application
below.

.. _hierarchical_clustering:

Hierarchical clustering
=======================

Hierarchical clustering is a general family of clustering algorithms that
build nested clusters by merging or splitting them successively. This
hierarchy of clusters is represented as a tree (or dendrogram). The root of the
tree is the unique cluster that gathers all the samples, the leaves being the
clusters with only one sample. See the `Wikipedia page
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering>`_ for more details.

The :class:`AgglomerativeClustering` object performs a hierarchical clustering
using a bottom up approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and
clusters are successively merged together. The linkage criteria determines the
metric used for the merge strategy:

- **Ward** minimizes the sum of squared differences within all clusters. It is a
  variance-minimizing approach and in this sense is similar to the k-means
  objective function but tackled with an agglomerative hierarchical
  approach.
- **Maximum** or **complete linkage** minimizes the maximum distance between
  observations of pairs of clusters.
- **Average linkage** minimizes the average of the distances between all
  observations of pairs of clusters.
- **Single linkage** minimizes the distance between the closest
  observations of pairs of clusters.

:class:`AgglomerativeClustering` can also scale to large number of samples
when it is used jointly with a connectivity matrix, but is computationally
expensive when no connectivity constraints are added between samples: it
considers at each step all the possible merges.

.. topic:: :class:`FeatureAgglomeration`

   The :class:`FeatureAgglomeration` uses agglomerative clustering to
   group together features that look very similar, thus decreasing the
   number of features. It is a dimensionality reduction tool, see
   :ref:`data_reduction`.

Different linkage type: Ward, complete, average, and single linkage
-------------------------------------------------------------------

:class:`AgglomerativeClustering` supports Ward, single, average, and complete
linkage strategies.

    :target: ../auto_examples/cluster/plot_linkage_comparison.html
    :scale: 43

Agglomerative cluster has a "rich get richer" behavior that leads to
uneven cluster sizes. In this regard, single linkage is the worst
strategy, and Ward gives the most regular sizes. However, the affinity
(or distance used in clustering) cannot be varied with Ward, thus for non
Euclidean metrics, average linkage is a good alternative. Single linkage,
while not robust to noisy data, can be computed very efficiently and can
therefore be useful to provide hierarchical clustering of larger datasets.
Single linkage can also perform well on non-globular data.

  different linkage strategies in a real dataset.

    the different linkage strategies in toy datasets.


Visualization of cluster hierarchy
----------------------------------

It's possible to visualize the tree representing the hierarchical merging of clusters
as a dendrogram. Visual inspection can often be useful for understanding the structure
of the data, though more so in the case of small sample sizes.

* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_agglomerative_dendrogram.py`


Adding connectivity constraints
-------------------------------

An interesting aspect of :class:`AgglomerativeClustering` is that
connectivity constraints can be added to this algorithm (only adjacent
clusters can be merged together), through a connectivity matrix that defines
for each sample the neighboring samples following a given structure of the
data. For instance, in the swiss-roll example below, the connectivity
constraints forbid the merging of points that are not adjacent on the swiss
roll, and thus avoid forming clusters that extend across overlapping folds of
the roll.

.. |unstructured| image:: ../auto_examples/cluster/images/sphx_glr_plot_ward_structured_vs_unstructured_001.png
        :target: ../auto_examples/cluster/plot_ward_structured_vs_unstructured.html

.. |structured| image:: ../auto_examples/cluster/images/sphx_glr_plot_ward_structured_vs_unstructured_002.png
        :target: ../auto_examples/cluster/plot_ward_structured_vs_unstructured.html
        :scale: 49

.. centered:: |unstructured| |structured|

These constraint are useful to impose a certain local structure, but they
also make the algorithm faster, especially when the number of the samples
is high.

The connectivity constraints are imposed via an connectivity matrix: a
scipy sparse matrix that has elements only at the intersection of a row
and a column with indices of the dataset that should be connected. This
matrix can be constructed from a-priori information: for instance, you
may wish to cluster web pages by only merging pages with a link pointing
from one to another. It can also be learned from the data, for instance
using :func:`sklearn.neighbors.kneighbors_graph` to restrict
merging to nearest neighbors as in :ref:`this example
<sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_agglomerative_clustering.py>`, or
using :func:`sklearn.feature_extraction.image.grid_to_graph` to
enable only merging of neighboring pixels on an image, as in the
:ref:`coin <sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_coin_ward_segmentation.py>` example.

.. warning:: **Connectivity constraints with single, average and complete linkage**

    Connectivity constraints and single, complete or average linkage can enhance
    the 'rich getting richer' aspect of agglomerative clustering,
    particularly so if they are built with
    :func:`sklearn.neighbors.kneighbors_graph`. In the limit of a small
    number of clusters, they tend to give a few macroscopically occupied
    clusters and almost empty ones. (see the discussion in
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_agglomerative_clustering.py`).
    Single linkage is the most brittle linkage option with regard to this issue.

Varying the metric
-------------------

Single, average and complete linkage can be used with a variety of distances (or
affinities), in particular Euclidean distance (*l2*), Manhattan distance
(or Cityblock, or *l1*), cosine distance, or any precomputed affinity
matrix.

* *l1* distance is often good for sparse features, or sparse noise: i.e.
  many of the features are zero, as in text mining using occurrences of
  rare words.

* *cosine* distance is interesting because it is invariant to global
  scalings of the signal.

The guidelines for choosing a metric is to use one that maximizes the
distance between samples in different classes, and minimizes that within
each class.

Bisecting K-Means
-----------------

.. _bisect_k_means:

The :class:`BisectingKMeans` is an iterative variant of :class:`KMeans`, using
divisive hierarchical clustering. Instead of creating all centroids at once, centroids
are picked progressively based on a previous clustering: a cluster is split into two
new clusters repeatedly until the target number of clusters is reached.

:class:`BisectingKMeans` is more efficient than :class:`KMeans` when the number of
clusters is large since it only works on a subset of the data at each bisection
while :class:`KMeans` always works on the entire dataset.

Although :class:`BisectingKMeans` can't benefit from the advantages of the `"k-means++"`
initialization by design, it will still produce comparable results than
`KMeans(init="k-means++")` in terms of inertia at cheaper computational costs, and will
likely produce better results than `KMeans` with a random initialization.

This variant is more efficient to agglomerative clustering if the number of clusters is
small compared to the number of data points.

This variant also does not produce empty clusters.

There exist two strategies for selecting the cluster to split:
 - ``bisecting_strategy="largest_cluster"`` selects the cluster having the most points
 - ``bisecting_strategy="biggest_inertia"`` selects the cluster with biggest inertia
   (cluster with biggest Sum of Squared Errors within)

Picking by largest amount of data points in most cases produces result as
accurate as picking by inertia and is faster (especially for larger amount of data
points, where calculating error may be costly).

Picking by largest amount of data points will also likely produce clusters of similar
sizes while `KMeans` is known to produce clusters of different sizes.

Difference between Bisecting K-Means and regular K-Means can be seen on example
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_bisect_kmeans.py`.
While the regular K-Means algorithm tends to create non-related clusters,
clusters from Bisecting K-Means are well ordered and create quite a visible hierarchy.

.. _dbscan:

DBSCAN
======

The :class:`DBSCAN` algorithm views clusters as areas of high density
separated by areas of low density. Due to this rather generic view, clusters
found by DBSCAN can be any shape, as opposed to k-means which assumes that
clusters are convex shaped. The central component to the DBSCAN is the concept
of *core samples*, which are samples that are in areas of high density. A
cluster is therefore a set of core samples, each close to each other
(measured by some distance measure)
and a set of non-core samples that are close to a core sample (but are not
themselves core samples). There are two parameters to the algorithm,
``min_samples`` and ``eps``,
which define formally what we mean when we say *dense*.
Higher ``min_samples`` or lower ``eps``
indicate higher density necessary to form a cluster.

More formally, we define a core sample as being a sample in the dataset such
that there exist ``min_samples`` other samples within a distance of
``eps``, which are defined as *neighbors* of the core sample. This tells
us that the core sample is in a dense area of the vector space. A cluster
is a set of core samples that can be built by recursively taking a core
sample, finding all of its neighbors that are core samples, finding all of
*their* neighbors that are core samples, and so on. A cluster also has a
set of non-core samples, which are samples that are neighbors of a core sample
in the cluster but are not themselves core samples. Intuitively, these samples
are on the fringes of a cluster.

Any core sample is part of a cluster, by definition. Any sample that is not a
core sample, and is at least ``eps`` in distance from any core sample, is
considered an outlier by the algorithm.

While the parameter ``min_samples`` primarily controls how tolerant the
algorithm is towards noise (on noisy and large data sets it may be desirable
to increase this parameter), the parameter ``eps`` is *crucial to choose
appropriately* for the data set and distance function and usually cannot be
left at the default value. It controls the local neighborhood of the points.
When chosen too small, most data will not be clustered at all (and labeled
as ``-1`` for "noise"). When chosen too large, it causes close clusters to
be merged into one cluster, and eventually the entire data set to be returned
as a single cluster. Some heuristics for choosing this parameter have been
discussed in the literature, for example based on a knee in the nearest neighbor
distances plot (as discussed in the references below).

In the figure below, the color indicates cluster membership, with large circles
indicating core samples found by the algorithm. Smaller circles are non-core
samples that are still part of a cluster. Moreover, the outliers are indicated
by black points below.

.. dropdown:: Implementation

  The DBSCAN algorithm is deterministic, always generating the same clusters when
  given the same data in the same order.  However, the results can differ when
  data is provided in a different order. First, even though the core samples will
  always be assigned to the same clusters, the labels of those clusters will
  depend on the order in which those samples are encountered in the data. Second
  and more importantly, the clusters to which non-core samples are assigned can
  differ depending on the data order.  This would happen when a non-core sample
  has a distance lower than ``eps`` to two core samples in different clusters. By
  the triangular inequality, those two core samples must be more distant than
  ``eps`` from each other, or they would be in the same cluster. The non-core
  sample is assigned to whichever cluster is generated first in a pass through the
  data, and so the results will depend on the data ordering.

  The current implementation uses ball trees and kd-trees to determine the
  neighborhood of points, which avoids calculating the full distance matrix (as
  was done in scikit-learn versions before 0.14). The possibility to use custom
  metrics is retained; for details, see :class:`NearestNeighbors`.

.. dropdown:: Memory consumption for large sample sizes

  This implementation is by default not memory efficient because it constructs a
  full pairwise similarity matrix in the case where kd-trees or ball-trees cannot
  be used (e.g., with sparse matrices). This matrix will consume :math:`n^2`
  floats. A couple of mechanisms for getting around this are:

  - Use :ref:`OPTICS <optics>` clustering in conjunction with the `extract_dbscan`
    method. OPTICS clustering also calculates the full pairwise matrix, but only
    keeps one row in memory at a time (memory complexity n).

  - A sparse radius neighborhood graph (where missing entries are presumed to be
    out of eps) can be precomputed in a memory-efficient way and dbscan can be run
    over this with ``metric='precomputed'``.  See
    :meth:`sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors_graph`.

  - The dataset can be compressed, either by removing exact duplicates if these
    occur in your data, or by using BIRCH. Then you only have a relatively small
    number of representatives for a large number of points. You can then provide a
    ``sample_weight`` when fitting DBSCAN.

.. _hdbscan:

HDBSCAN
=======

The :class:`HDBSCAN` algorithm can be seen as an extension of :class:`DBSCAN`
and :class:`OPTICS`. Specifically, :class:`DBSCAN` assumes that the clustering
criterion (i.e. density requirement) is *globally homogeneous*.
In other words, :class:`DBSCAN` may struggle to successfully capture clusters
with different densities.
:class:`HDBSCAN` alleviates this assumption and explores all possible density
scales by building an alternative representation of the clustering problem.

.. note::

  This implementation is adapted from the original implementation of HDBSCAN,
  `scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan <https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan>`_ based on [LJ2017]_.

.. rubric:: Examples

* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_hdbscan.py`

Mutual Reachability Graph
-------------------------

HDBSCAN first defines :math:`d_c(x_p)`, the *core distance* of a sample :math:`x_p`, as the
distance to its `min_samples` th-nearest neighbor, counting itself. For example,
if `min_samples=5` and :math:`x_*` is the 5th-nearest neighbor of :math:`x_p`
then the core distance is:

.. math:: d_c(x_p)=d(x_p, x_*).

Next it defines :math:`d_m(x_p, x_q)`, the *mutual reachability distance* of two points
:math:`x_p, x_q`, as:

.. math:: d_m(x_p, x_q) = \max\{d_c(x_p), d_c(x_q), d(x_p, x_q)\}

These two notions allow us to construct the *mutual reachability graph*
:math:`G_{ms}` defined for a fixed choice of `min_samples` by associating each
sample :math:`x_p` with a vertex of the graph, and thus edges between points
:math:`x_p, x_q` are the mutual reachability distance :math:`d_m(x_p, x_q)`
between them. We may build subsets of this graph, denoted as
:math:`G_{ms,\varepsilon}`, by removing any edges with value greater than :math:`\varepsilon`:
from the original graph. Any points whose core distance is less than :math:`\varepsilon`:
are at this staged marked as noise. The remaining points are then clustered by
finding the connected components of this trimmed graph.

.. note::

  Taking the connected components of a trimmed graph :math:`G_{ms,\varepsilon}` is
  equivalent to running DBSCAN* with `min_samples` and :math:`\varepsilon`. DBSCAN* is a
  slightly modified version of DBSCAN mentioned in [CM2013]_.

Hierarchical Clustering
-----------------------
HDBSCAN can be seen as an algorithm which performs DBSCAN* clustering across all
values of :math:`\varepsilon`. As mentioned prior, this is equivalent to finding the connected
components of the mutual reachability graphs for all values of :math:`\varepsilon`. To do this
efficiently, HDBSCAN first extracts a minimum spanning tree (MST) from the fully
-connected mutual reachability graph, then greedily cuts the edges with highest
weight. An outline of the HDBSCAN algorithm is as follows:

1. Extract the MST of :math:`G_{ms}`.
2. Extend the MST by adding a "self edge" for each vertex, with weight equal
   to the core distance of the underlying sample.
3. Initialize a single cluster and label for the MST.
4. Remove the edge with the greatest weight from the MST (ties are
   removed simultaneously).
5. Assign cluster labels to the connected components which contain the
   end points of the now-removed edge. If the component does not have at least
   one edge it is instead assigned a "null" label marking it as noise.
6. Repeat 4-5 until there are no more connected components.

HDBSCAN is therefore able to obtain all possible partitions achievable by
DBSCAN* for a fixed choice of `min_samples` in a hierarchical fashion.
Indeed, this allows HDBSCAN to perform clustering across multiple densities
and as such it no longer needs :math:`\varepsilon` to be given as a hyperparameter. Instead
it relies solely on the choice of `min_samples`, which tends to be a more robust
hyperparameter.

HDBSCAN can be smoothed with an additional hyperparameter `min_cluster_size`
which specifies that during the hierarchical clustering, components with fewer
than `minimum_cluster_size` many samples are considered noise. In practice, one
can set `minimum_cluster_size = min_samples` to couple the parameters and
simplify the hyperparameter space.

.. _optics:

OPTICS
======

The :class:`OPTICS` algorithm shares many similarities with the :class:`DBSCAN`
algorithm, and can be considered a generalization of DBSCAN that relaxes the
``eps`` requirement from a single value to a value range. The key difference
between DBSCAN and OPTICS is that the OPTICS algorithm builds a *reachability*
graph, which assigns each sample both a ``reachability_`` distance, and a spot
within the cluster ``ordering_`` attribute; these two attributes are assigned
when the model is fitted, and are used to determine cluster membership. If
OPTICS is run with the default value of *inf* set for ``max_eps``, then DBSCAN
style cluster extraction can be performed repeatedly in linear time for any
given ``eps`` value using the ``cluster_optics_dbscan`` method. Setting
``max_eps`` to a lower value will result in shorter run times, and can be
thought of as the maximum neighborhood radius from each point to find other
potential reachable points.

.. |optics_results| image:: ../auto_examples/cluster/images/sphx_glr_plot_optics_001.png
        :target: ../auto_examples/cluster/plot_optics.html
        :scale: 50

.. centered:: |optics_results|

The *reachability* distances generated by OPTICS allow for variable density
extraction of clusters within a single data set. As shown in the above plot,
combining *reachability* distances and data set ``ordering_`` produces a
*reachability plot*, where point density is represented on the Y-axis, and
points are ordered such that nearby points are adjacent. 'Cutting' the
reachability plot at a single value produces DBSCAN like results; all points
above the 'cut' are classified as noise, and each time that there is a break
when reading from left to right signifies a new cluster. The default cluster
extraction with OPTICS looks at the steep slopes within the graph to find
clusters, and the user can define what counts as a steep slope using the
parameter ``xi``. There are also other possibilities for analysis on the graph
itself, such as generating hierarchical representations of the data through
reachability-plot dendrograms, and the hierarchy of clusters detected by the
algorithm can be accessed through the ``cluster_hierarchy_`` parameter. The
plot above has been color-coded so that cluster colors in planar space match
the linear segment clusters of the reachability plot. Note that the blue and
red clusters are adjacent in the reachability plot, and can be hierarchically
represented as children of a larger parent cluster.

.. dropdown:: Comparison with DBSCAN

  The results from OPTICS ``cluster_optics_dbscan`` method and DBSCAN are very
  similar, but not always identical; specifically, labeling of periphery and noise
  points. This is in part because the first samples of each dense area processed
  by OPTICS have a large reachability value while being close to other points in
  their area, and will thus sometimes be marked as noise rather than periphery.
  This affects adjacent points when they are considered as candidates for being
  marked as either periphery or noise.

  Note that for any single value of ``eps``, DBSCAN will tend to have a shorter
  run time than OPTICS; however, for repeated runs at varying ``eps`` values, a
  single run of OPTICS may require less cumulative runtime than DBSCAN. It is also
  important to note that OPTICS' output is close to DBSCAN's only if ``eps`` and
  ``max_eps`` are close.

.. dropdown:: Computational Complexity

  Spatial indexing trees are used to avoid calculating the full distance matrix,
  and allow for efficient memory usage on large sets of samples. Different
  distance metrics can be supplied via the ``metric`` keyword.

  For large datasets, similar (but not identical) results can be obtained via
  :class:`HDBSCAN`. The HDBSCAN implementation is multithreaded, and has better
  algorithmic runtime complexity than OPTICS, at the cost of worse memory scaling.
  For extremely large datasets that exhaust system memory using HDBSCAN, OPTICS
  will maintain :math:`n` (as opposed to :math:`n^2`) memory scaling; however,
  tuning of the ``max_eps`` parameter will likely need to be used to give a
  solution in a reasonable amount of wall time.

.. _birch:

BIRCH
=====

The :class:`Birch` builds a tree called the Clustering Feature Tree (CFT)
for the given data. The data is essentially lossy compressed to a set of
Clustering Feature nodes (CF Nodes). The CF Nodes have a number of
subclusters called Clustering Feature subclusters (CF Subclusters)
and these CF Subclusters located in the non-terminal CF Nodes
can have CF Nodes as children.

The CF Subclusters hold the necessary information for clustering which prevents
the need to hold the entire input data in memory. This information includes:

- Number of samples in a subcluster.
- Linear Sum - An n-dimensional vector holding the sum of all samples
- Squared Sum - Sum of the squared L2 norm of all samples.
- Centroids - To avoid recalculation linear sum / n_samples.
- Squared norm of the centroids.

The BIRCH algorithm has two parameters, the threshold and the branching factor.
The branching factor limits the number of subclusters in a node and the
threshold limits the distance between the entering sample and the existing
subclusters.

This algorithm can be viewed as an instance or data reduction method,
since it reduces the input data to a set of subclusters which are obtained directly
from the leaves of the CFT. This reduced data can be further processed by feeding
it into a global clusterer. This global clusterer can be set by ``n_clusters``.
If ``n_clusters`` is set to None, the subclusters from the leaves are directly
read off, otherwise a global clustering step labels these subclusters into global
clusters (labels) and the samples are mapped to the global label of the nearest subcluster.

.. dropdown:: Algorithm description

  - A new sample is inserted into the root of the CF Tree which is a CF Node. It
    is then merged with the subcluster of the root, that has the smallest radius
    after merging, constrained by the threshold and branching factor conditions.
    If the subcluster has any child node, then this is done repeatedly till it
    reaches a leaf. After finding the nearest subcluster in the leaf, the
    properties of this subcluster and the parent subclusters are recursively
    updated.

  - If the radius of the subcluster obtained by merging the new sample and the
    nearest subcluster is greater than the square of the threshold and if the
    number of subclusters is greater than the branching factor, then a space is
    temporarily allocated to this new sample. The two farthest subclusters are
    taken and the subclusters are divided into two groups on the basis of the
    distance between these subclusters.

  - If this split node has a parent subcluster and there is room for a new
    subcluster, then the parent is split into two. If there is no room, then this
    node is again split into two and the process is continued recursively, till it
    reaches the root.

.. dropdown:: BIRCH or MiniBatchKMeans?

  - BIRCH does not scale very well to high dimensional data. As a rule of thumb if
    ``n_features`` is greater than twenty, it is generally better to use MiniBatchKMeans.
  - If the number of instances of data needs to be reduced, or if one wants a
    large number of subclusters either as a preprocessing step or otherwise,
    BIRCH is more useful than MiniBatchKMeans.

.. dropdown:: How to use partial_fit?

  To avoid the computation of global clustering, for every call of ``partial_fit``
  the user is advised:

  1. To set ``n_clusters=None`` initially.
  2. Train all data by multiple calls to partial_fit.
  3. Set ``n_clusters`` to a required value using
     ``brc.set_params(n_clusters=n_clusters)``.
  4. Call ``partial_fit`` finally with no arguments, i.e. ``brc.partial_fit()``
     which performs the global clustering.

.. _clustering_evaluation:

Clustering performance evaluation
=================================

Evaluating the performance of a clustering algorithm is not as trivial as
counting the number of errors or the precision and recall of a supervised
classification algorithm. In particular any evaluation metric should not
take the absolute values of the cluster labels into account but rather
if this clustering define separations of the data similar to some ground
truth set of classes or satisfying some assumption such that members
belong to the same class are more similar than members of different
classes according to some similarity metric.

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.metrics

.. _rand_score:
.. _adjusted_rand_score:

Rand index
----------

Given the knowledge of the ground truth class assignments
``labels_true`` and our clustering algorithm assignments of the same
samples ``labels_pred``, the **(adjusted or unadjusted) Rand index**
is a function that measures the **similarity** of the two assignments,
ignoring permutations::

  >>> from sklearn import metrics
  >>> labels_true = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  >>> labels_pred = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
  >>> metrics.rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.66...

The Rand index does not ensure to obtain a value close to 0.0 for a
random labelling. The adjusted Rand index **corrects for chance** and
will give such a baseline.

  >>> metrics.adjusted_rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.24...

As with all clustering metrics, one can permute 0 and 1 in the predicted
labels, rename 2 to 3, and get the same score::

  >>> labels_pred = [1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3]
  >>> metrics.rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.66...
  >>> metrics.adjusted_rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.24...

Furthermore, both :func:`rand_score` :func:`adjusted_rand_score` are
**symmetric**: swapping the argument does not change the scores. They can
thus be used as **consensus measures**::

  >>> metrics.rand_score(labels_pred, labels_true)
  0.66...
  >>> metrics.adjusted_rand_score(labels_pred, labels_true)
  0.24...

Perfect labeling is scored 1.0::

  >>> labels_pred = labels_true[:]
  >>> metrics.rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  1.0
  >>> metrics.adjusted_rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  1.0

Poorly agreeing labels (e.g. independent labelings) have lower scores,
and for the adjusted Rand index the score will be negative or close to
zero. However, for the unadjusted Rand index the score, while lower,
will not necessarily be close to zero.::

  >>> labels_true = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
  >>> labels_pred = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]
  >>> metrics.rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.39...
  >>> metrics.adjusted_rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  -0.07...


.. topic:: Advantages:

  - **Interpretability**: The unadjusted Rand index is proportional to the
    number of sample pairs whose labels are the same in both `labels_pred` and
    `labels_true`, or are different in both.

  - **Random (uniform) label assignments have an adjusted Rand index score close
    to 0.0** for any value of ``n_clusters`` and ``n_samples`` (which is not the
    case for the unadjusted Rand index or the V-measure for instance).

  - **Bounded range**: Lower values indicate different labelings, similar
    clusterings have a high (adjusted or unadjusted) Rand index, 1.0 is the
    perfect match score. The score range is [0, 1] for the unadjusted Rand index
    and [-0.5, 1] for the adjusted Rand index.

  - **No assumption is made on the cluster structure**: The (adjusted or
    unadjusted) Rand index can be used to compare all kinds of clustering
    algorithms, and can be used to compare clustering algorithms such as k-means
    which assumes isotropic blob shapes with results of spectral clustering
    algorithms which can find cluster with "folded" shapes.

.. topic:: Drawbacks:

  - Contrary to inertia, the **(adjusted or unadjusted) Rand index requires
    knowledge of the ground truth classes** which is almost never available in
    practice or requires manual assignment by human annotators (as in the
    supervised learning setting).

    However (adjusted or unadjusted) Rand index can also be useful in a purely
    unsupervised setting as a building block for a Consensus Index that can be
    used for clustering model selection (TODO).

  - The **unadjusted Rand index is often close to 1.0** even if the clusterings
    themselves differ significantly. This can be understood when interpreting
    the Rand index as the accuracy of element pair labeling resulting from the
    clusterings: In practice there often is a majority of element pairs that are
    assigned the ``different`` pair label under both the predicted and the
    ground truth clustering resulting in a high proportion of pair labels that
    agree, which leads subsequently to a high score.

.. rubric:: Examples

* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_adjusted_for_chance_measures.py`:
  Analysis of the impact of the dataset size on the value of
  clustering measures for random assignments.

.. dropdown:: Mathematical formulation

  If C is a ground truth class assignment and K the clustering, let us define
  :math:`a` and :math:`b` as:

  - :math:`a`, the number of pairs of elements that are in the same set in C and
    in the same set in K

  - :math:`b`, the number of pairs of elements that are in different sets in C and
    in different sets in K

  The unadjusted Rand index is then given by:

  .. math:: \text{RI} = \frac{a + b}{C_2^{n_{samples}}}

  where :math:`C_2^{n_{samples}}` is the total number of possible pairs in the
  dataset. It does not matter if the calculation is performed on ordered pairs or
  unordered pairs as long as the calculation is performed consistently.

  However, the Rand index does not guarantee that random label assignments will
  get a value close to zero (esp. if the number of clusters is in the same order
  of magnitude as the number of samples).

  To counter this effect we can discount the expected RI :math:`E[\text{RI}]` of
  random labelings by defining the adjusted Rand index as follows:

  .. math:: \text{ARI} = \frac{\text{RI} - E[\text{RI}]}{\max(\text{RI}) - E[\text{RI}]}

.. _mutual_info_score:

Mutual Information based scores
-------------------------------

Given the knowledge of the ground truth class assignments ``labels_true`` and
our clustering algorithm assignments of the same samples ``labels_pred``, the
**Mutual Information** is a function that measures the **agreement** of the two
assignments, ignoring permutations.  Two different normalized versions of this
measure are available, **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)** and **Adjusted
Mutual Information (AMI)**. NMI is often used in the literature, while AMI was
proposed more recently and is **normalized against chance**::

  >>> from sklearn import metrics
  >>> labels_true = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  >>> labels_pred = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

  >>> metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred)  # doctest: +SKIP
  0.22504...

One can permute 0 and 1 in the predicted labels, rename 2 to 3 and get
the same score::

  >>> labels_pred = [1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3]
  >>> metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred)  # doctest: +SKIP
  0.22504...

All, :func:`mutual_info_score`, :func:`adjusted_mutual_info_score` and
:func:`normalized_mutual_info_score` are symmetric: swapping the argument does
not change the score. Thus they can be used as a **consensus measure**::

  >>> metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score(labels_pred, labels_true)  # doctest: +SKIP
  0.22504...

Perfect labeling is scored 1.0::

  >>> labels_pred = labels_true[:]
  >>> metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred)  # doctest: +SKIP
  1.0

  >>> metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred)  # doctest: +SKIP
  1.0

This is not true for ``mutual_info_score``, which is therefore harder to judge::

  >>> metrics.mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred)  # doctest: +SKIP
  0.69...

Bad (e.g. independent labelings) have non-positive scores::

  >>> labels_true = [0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 5, 1]
  >>> labels_pred = [1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  >>> metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred)  # doctest: +SKIP
  -0.10526...


.. topic:: Advantages:

  - **Random (uniform) label assignments have a AMI score close to 0.0** for any
    value of ``n_clusters`` and ``n_samples`` (which is not the case for raw
    Mutual Information or the V-measure for instance).

  - **Upper bound  of 1**:  Values close to zero indicate two label assignments
    that are largely independent, while values close to one indicate significant
    agreement. Further, an AMI of exactly 1 indicates that the two label
    assignments are equal (with or without permutation).

.. topic:: Drawbacks:

  - Contrary to inertia, **MI-based measures require the knowledge of the ground
    truth classes** while almost never available in practice or requires manual
    assignment by human annotators (as in the supervised learning setting).

    However MI-based measures can also be useful in purely unsupervised setting
    as a building block for a Consensus Index that can be used for clustering
    model selection.

  - NMI and MI are not adjusted against chance.

.. rubric:: Examples

* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_adjusted_for_chance_measures.py`: Analysis
  of the impact of the dataset size on the value of clustering measures for random
  assignments. This example also includes the Adjusted Rand Index.

.. dropdown:: Mathematical formulation

  Assume two label assignments (of the same N objects), :math:`U` and :math:`V`.
  Their entropy is the amount of uncertainty for a partition set, defined by:

  .. math:: H(U) = - \sum_{i=1}^{|U|}P(i)\log(P(i))

  where :math:`P(i) = |U_i| / N` is the probability that an object picked at
  random from :math:`U` falls into class :math:`U_i`. Likewise for :math:`V`:

  .. math:: H(V) = - \sum_{j=1}^{|V|}P'(j)\log(P'(j))

  With :math:`P'(j) = |V_j| / N`. The mutual information (MI) between :math:`U`
  and :math:`V` is calculated by:

  .. math:: \text{MI}(U, V) = \sum_{i=1}^{|U|}\sum_{j=1}^{|V|}P(i, j)\log\left(\frac{P(i,j)}{P(i)P'(j)}\right)

  where :math:`P(i, j) = |U_i \cap V_j| / N` is the probability that an object
  picked at random falls into both classes :math:`U_i` and :math:`V_j`.

  It also can be expressed in set cardinality formulation:

  .. math:: \text{MI}(U, V) = \sum_{i=1}^{|U|} \sum_{j=1}^{|V|} \frac{|U_i \cap V_j|}{N}\log\left(\frac{N|U_i \cap V_j|}{|U_i||V_j|}\right)

  The normalized mutual information is defined as

  .. math:: \text{NMI}(U, V) = \frac{\text{MI}(U, V)}{\text{mean}(H(U), H(V))}

  This value of the mutual information and also the normalized variant is not
  adjusted for chance and will tend to increase as the number of different labels
  (clusters) increases, regardless of the actual amount of "mutual information"
  between the label assignments.

  The expected value for the mutual information can be calculated using the
  following equation [VEB2009]_. In this equation, :math:`a_i = |U_i|` (the number
  of elements in :math:`U_i`) and :math:`b_j = |V_j|` (the number of elements in
  :math:`V_j`).

  .. math:: E[\text{MI}(U,V)]=\sum_{i=1}^{|U|} \sum_{j=1}^{|V|} \sum_{n_{ij}=(a_i+b_j-N)^+
    }^{\min(a_i, b_j)} \frac{n_{ij}}{N}\log \left( \frac{ N.n_{ij}}{a_i b_j}\right)
    \frac{a_i!b_j!(N-a_i)!(N-b_j)!}{N!n_{ij}!(a_i-n_{ij})!(b_j-n_{ij})!
    (N-a_i-b_j+n_{ij})!}

  Using the expected value, the adjusted mutual information can then be calculated
  using a similar form to that of the adjusted Rand index:

  .. math:: \text{AMI} = \frac{\text{MI} - E[\text{MI}]}{\text{mean}(H(U), H(V)) - E[\text{MI}]}

  For normalized mutual information and adjusted mutual information, the
  normalizing value is typically some *generalized* mean of the entropies of each
  clustering. Various generalized means exist, and no firm rules exist for
  preferring one over the others.  The decision is largely a field-by-field basis;
  for instance, in community detection, the arithmetic mean is most common. Each
  normalizing method provides "qualitatively similar behaviours" [YAT2016]_. In
  our implementation, this is controlled by the ``average_method`` parameter.

  Vinh et al. (2010) named variants of NMI and AMI by their averaging method
  [VEB2010]_. Their 'sqrt' and 'sum' averages are the geometric and arithmetic
  means; we use these more broadly common names.

.. _homogeneity_completeness:

Homogeneity, completeness and V-measure
---------------------------------------

Given the knowledge of the ground truth class assignments of the samples,
it is possible to define some intuitive metric using conditional entropy
analysis.

In particular Rosenberg and Hirschberg (2007) define the following two
desirable objectives for any cluster assignment:

- **homogeneity**: each cluster contains only members of a single class.

- **completeness**: all members of a given class are assigned to the same
  cluster.

We can turn those concept as scores :func:`homogeneity_score` and
:func:`completeness_score`. Both are bounded below by 0.0 and above by
1.0 (higher is better)::

  >>> from sklearn import metrics
  >>> labels_true = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  >>> labels_pred = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

  >>> metrics.homogeneity_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.66...

  >>> metrics.completeness_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.42...

Their harmonic mean called **V-measure** is computed by
:func:`v_measure_score`::

  >>> metrics.v_measure_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.51...

This function's formula is as follows:

.. math:: v = \frac{(1 + \beta) \times \text{homogeneity} \times \text{completeness}}{(\beta \times \text{homogeneity} + \text{completeness})}

`beta` defaults to a value of 1.0, but for using a value less than 1 for beta::

  >>> metrics.v_measure_score(labels_true, labels_pred, beta=0.6)
  0.54...

more weight will be attributed to homogeneity, and using a value greater than 1::

  >>> metrics.v_measure_score(labels_true, labels_pred, beta=1.8)
  0.48...

more weight will be attributed to completeness.

The V-measure is actually equivalent to the mutual information (NMI)
discussed above, with the aggregation function being the arithmetic mean [B2011]_.

Homogeneity, completeness and V-measure can be computed at once using
:func:`homogeneity_completeness_v_measure` as follows::

  >>> metrics.homogeneity_completeness_v_measure(labels_true, labels_pred)
  (0.66..., 0.42..., 0.51...)

The following clustering assignment is slightly better, since it is
homogeneous but not complete::

  >>> labels_pred = [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2]
  >>> metrics.homogeneity_completeness_v_measure(labels_true, labels_pred)
  (1.0, 0.68..., 0.81...)

.. note::

  :func:`v_measure_score` is **symmetric**: it can be used to evaluate
  the **agreement** of two independent assignments on the same dataset.

  This is not the case for :func:`completeness_score` and
  :func:`homogeneity_score`: both are bound by the relationship::

    homogeneity_score(a, b) == completeness_score(b, a)


.. topic:: Advantages:

  - **Bounded scores**: 0.0 is as bad as it can be, 1.0 is a perfect score.

  - Intuitive interpretation: clustering with bad V-measure can be
    **qualitatively analyzed in terms of homogeneity and completeness** to
    better feel what 'kind' of mistakes is done by the assignment.

  - **No assumption is made on the cluster structure**: can be used to compare
    clustering algorithms such as k-means which assumes isotropic blob shapes
    with results of spectral clustering algorithms which can find cluster with
    "folded" shapes.

.. topic:: Drawbacks:

  - The previously introduced metrics are **not normalized with regards to
    random labeling**: this means that depending on the number of samples,
    clusters and ground truth classes, a completely random labeling will not
    always yield the same values for homogeneity, completeness and hence
    v-measure. In particular **random labeling won't yield zero scores
    especially when the number of clusters is large**.

    This problem can safely be ignored when the number of samples is more than a
    thousand and the number of clusters is less than 10. **For smaller sample
    sizes or larger number of clusters it is safer to use an adjusted index such
    as the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**.

    :scale: 100

  - These metrics **require the knowledge of the ground truth classes** while
    almost never available in practice or requires manual assignment by human
    annotators (as in the supervised learning setting).

  Homogeneity and completeness scores are formally given by:

  .. math:: h = 1 - \frac{H(C|K)}{H(C)}

  .. math:: c = 1 - \frac{H(K|C)}{H(K)}

  where :math:`H(C|K)` is the **conditional entropy of the classes given the
  cluster assignments** and is given by:

  .. math:: H(C|K) = - \sum_{c=1}^{|C|} \sum_{k=1}^{|K|} \frac{n_{c,k}}{n}
            \cdot \log\left(\frac{n_{c,k}}{n_k}\right)

  and :math:`H(C)` is the **entropy of the classes** and is given by:

  .. math:: H(C) = - \sum_{c=1}^{|C|} \frac{n_c}{n} \cdot \log\left(\frac{n_c}{n}\right)

  with :math:`n` the total number of samples, :math:`n_c` and :math:`n_k` the
  number of samples respectively belonging to class :math:`c` and cluster
  :math:`k`, and finally :math:`n_{c,k}` the number of samples from class
  :math:`c` assigned to cluster :math:`k`.

  The **conditional entropy of clusters given class** :math:`H(K|C)` and the
  **entropy of clusters** :math:`H(K)` are defined in a symmetric manner.

  Rosenberg and Hirschberg further define **V-measure** as the **harmonic mean of
  homogeneity and completeness**:

.. _fowlkes_mallows_scores:

Fowlkes-Mallows scores
----------------------

The original Fowlkes-Mallows index (FMI) was intended to measure the similarity
between two clustering results, which is inherently an unsupervised comparison.
The supervised adaptation of the Fowlkes-Mallows index
(as implemented in :func:`sklearn.metrics.fowlkes_mallows_score`) can be used
when the ground truth class assignments of the samples are known.
The FMI is defined as the geometric mean of the pairwise precision and recall:

.. math:: \text{FMI} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\sqrt{(\text{TP} + \text{FP}) (\text{TP} + \text{FN})}}

In the above formula:

* ``TP`` (**True Positive**): The number of pairs of points that are clustered together
  both in the true labels and in the predicted labels.

* ``FP`` (**False Positive**): The number of pairs of points that are clustered together
  in the predicted labels but not in the true labels.

* ``FN`` (**False Negative**): The number of pairs of points that are clustered together
  in the true labels but not in the predicted labels.

The score ranges from 0 to 1. A high value indicates a good similarity
between two clusters.

  >>> from sklearn import metrics
  >>> labels_true = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
  >>> labels_pred = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

  >>> metrics.fowlkes_mallows_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.47140...

One can permute 0 and 1 in the predicted labels, rename 2 to 3 and get
the same score::

  >>> labels_pred = [1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3]

  >>> metrics.fowlkes_mallows_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.47140...

Perfect labeling is scored 1.0::

  >>> labels_pred = labels_true[:]
  >>> metrics.fowlkes_mallows_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  1.0

Bad (e.g. independent labelings) have zero scores::

  >>> labels_true = [0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 5, 1]
  >>> labels_pred = [1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]
  >>> metrics.fowlkes_mallows_score(labels_true, labels_pred)
  0.0

.. topic:: Advantages:

  - **Random (uniform) label assignments have a FMI score close to 0.0** for any
    value of ``n_clusters`` and ``n_samples`` (which is not the case for raw
    Mutual Information or the V-measure for instance).

  - **Upper-bounded at 1**:  Values close to zero indicate two label assignments
    that are largely independent, while values close to one indicate significant
    agreement. Further, values of exactly 0 indicate **purely** independent
    label assignments and a FMI of exactly 1 indicates that the two label
    assignments are equal (with or without permutation).

  - **No assumption is made on the cluster structure**: can be used to compare
    clustering algorithms such as k-means which assumes isotropic blob shapes
    with results of spectral clustering algorithms which can find cluster with
    "folded" shapes.

.. topic:: Drawbacks:

  - Contrary to inertia, **FMI-based measures require the knowledge of the
    ground truth classes** while almost never available in practice or requires
    manual assignment by human annotators (as in the supervised learning
    setting).

If the ground truth labels are not known, evaluation must be performed using
the model itself. The Silhouette Coefficient
(:func:`sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score`)
is an example of such an evaluation, where a
higher Silhouette Coefficient score relates to a model with better defined
clusters. The Silhouette Coefficient is defined for each sample and is composed
of two scores:

- **a**: The mean distance between a sample and all other points in the same
  class.

- **b**: The mean distance between a sample and all other points in the *next
  nearest cluster*.

The Silhouette Coefficient *s* for a single sample is then given as:

.. math:: s = \frac{b - a}{max(a, b)}

The Silhouette Coefficient for a set of samples is given as the mean of the
Silhouette Coefficient for each sample.


  >>> from sklearn import metrics
  >>> from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances
  >>> from sklearn import datasets
  >>> X, y = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)

In normal usage, the Silhouette Coefficient is applied to the results of a
cluster analysis.

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
  >>> kmeans_model = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=1).fit(X)
  >>> labels = kmeans_model.labels_
  >>> metrics.silhouette_score(X, labels, metric='euclidean')
  0.55...

.. topic:: Advantages:

  - The score is bounded between -1 for incorrect clustering and +1 for highly
    dense clustering. Scores around zero indicate overlapping clusters.

  - The score is higher when clusters are dense and well separated, which
    relates to a standard concept of a cluster.

.. topic:: Drawbacks:

  - The Silhouette Coefficient is generally higher for convex clusters than
    other concepts of clusters, such as density based clusters like those
    obtained through DBSCAN.

.. _calinski_harabasz_index:

Calinski-Harabasz Index
-----------------------


If the ground truth labels are not known, the Calinski-Harabasz index
(:func:`sklearn.metrics.calinski_harabasz_score`) - also known as the Variance
Ratio Criterion - can be used to evaluate the model, where a higher
Calinski-Harabasz score relates to a model with better defined clusters.

The index is the ratio of the sum of between-clusters dispersion and of
within-cluster dispersion for all clusters (where dispersion is defined as the
sum of distances squared):

  >>> from sklearn import metrics
  >>> from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances
  >>> from sklearn import datasets
  >>> X, y = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)

In normal usage, the Calinski-Harabasz index is applied to the results of a
cluster analysis:

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
  >>> kmeans_model = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=1).fit(X)
  >>> labels = kmeans_model.labels_
  >>> metrics.calinski_harabasz_score(X, labels)
  561.59...


.. topic:: Advantages:

  - The score is higher when clusters are dense and well separated, which
    relates to a standard concept of a cluster.

  - The score is fast to compute.

.. topic:: Drawbacks:

  - The Calinski-Harabasz index is generally higher for convex clusters than
    other concepts of clusters, such as density based clusters like those
    obtained through DBSCAN.

.. dropdown:: Mathematical formulation

  For a set of data :math:`E` of size :math:`n_E` which has been clustered into
  :math:`k` clusters, the Calinski-Harabasz score :math:`s` is defined as the
  ratio of the between-clusters dispersion mean and the within-cluster
  dispersion:

  .. math::
    s = \frac{\mathrm{tr}(B_k)}{\mathrm{tr}(W_k)} \times \frac{n_E - k}{k - 1}

  where :math:`\mathrm{tr}(B_k)` is trace of the between group dispersion matrix
  and :math:`\mathrm{tr}(W_k)` is the trace of the within-cluster dispersion
  matrix defined by:

  .. math:: W_k = \sum_{q=1}^k \sum_{x \in C_q} (x - c_q) (x - c_q)^T

  .. math:: B_k = \sum_{q=1}^k n_q (c_q - c_E) (c_q - c_E)^T

  with :math:`C_q` the set of points in cluster :math:`q`, :math:`c_q` the
  center of cluster :math:`q`, :math:`c_E` the center of :math:`E`, and
  :math:`n_q` the number of points in cluster :math:`q`.

.. _davies-bouldin_index:

Davies-Bouldin Index
--------------------

If the ground truth labels are not known, the Davies-Bouldin index
(:func:`sklearn.metrics.davies_bouldin_score`) can be used to evaluate the
model, where a lower Davies-Bouldin index relates to a model with better
separation between the clusters.

This index signifies the average 'similarity' between clusters, where the
similarity is a measure that compares the distance between clusters with the
size of the clusters themselves.

Zero is the lowest possible score. Values closer to zero indicate a better
partition.

In normal usage, the Davies-Bouldin index is applied to the results of a
cluster analysis as follows:

  >>> from sklearn import datasets
  >>> iris = datasets.load_iris()
  >>> X = iris.data
  >>> from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
  >>> from sklearn.metrics import davies_bouldin_score
  >>> kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=1).fit(X)
  >>> labels = kmeans.labels_
  >>> davies_bouldin_score(X, labels)
  0.666...


.. topic:: Advantages:

  - The computation of Davies-Bouldin is simpler than that of Silhouette scores.
  - The index is solely based on quantities and features inherent to the dataset
    as its computation only uses point-wise distances.

.. topic:: Drawbacks:

  - The Davies-Boulding index is generally higher for convex clusters than other
    concepts of clusters, such as density based clusters like those obtained
    from DBSCAN.
  - The usage of centroid distance limits the distance metric to Euclidean
    space.

.. dropdown:: Mathematical formulation

  The index is defined as the average similarity between each cluster :math:`C_i`
  for :math:`i=1, ..., k` and its most similar one :math:`C_j`. In the context of
  this index, similarity is defined as a measure :math:`R_{ij}` that trades off:

  - :math:`s_i`, the average distance between each point of cluster :math:`i` and
    the centroid of that cluster -- also know as cluster diameter.
  - :math:`d_{ij}`, the distance between cluster centroids :math:`i` and
    :math:`j`.

  A simple choice to construct :math:`R_{ij}` so that it is nonnegative and
  symmetric is:

  .. math::
    R_{ij} = \frac{s_i + s_j}{d_{ij}}

  Then the Davies-Bouldin index is defined as:

  .. math::
    DB = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \max_{i \neq j} R_{ij}

.. _contingency_matrix:

Contingency Matrix
------------------

Contingency matrix (:func:`sklearn.metrics.cluster.contingency_matrix`)
reports the intersection cardinality for every true/predicted cluster pair.
The contingency matrix provides sufficient statistics for all clustering
metrics where the samples are independent and identically distributed and
one doesn't need to account for some instances not being clustered.

Here is an example::

   >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import contingency_matrix
   >>> x = ["a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b"]
   >>> y = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
   >>> contingency_matrix(x, y)
   array([[2, 1, 0],
          [0, 1, 2]])

The first row of output array indicates that there are three samples whose
true cluster is "a". Of them, two are in predicted cluster 0, one is in 1,
and none is in 2. And the second row indicates that there are three samples
whose true cluster is "b". Of them, none is in predicted cluster 0, one is in
1 and two are in 2.

A :ref:`confusion matrix <confusion_matrix>` for classification is a square
contingency matrix where the order of rows and columns correspond to a list
of classes.


.. topic:: Advantages:

  - Allows to examine the spread of each true cluster across predicted clusters
    and vice versa.

  - The contingency table calculated is typically utilized in the calculation of
    a similarity statistic (like the others listed in this document) between the
    two clusterings.

.. topic:: Drawbacks:

  - Contingency matrix is easy to interpret for a small number of clusters, but
    becomes very hard to interpret for a large number of clusters.

  - It doesn't give a single metric to use as an objective for clustering
    optimisation.

.. _pair_confusion_matrix:

Pair Confusion Matrix
---------------------

The pair confusion matrix
(:func:`sklearn.metrics.cluster.pair_confusion_matrix`) is a 2x2
similarity matrix

.. math::
   C = \left[\begin{matrix}
   C_{00} & C_{01} \\
   C_{10} & C_{11}
   \end{matrix}\right]

between two clusterings computed by considering all pairs of samples and
counting pairs that are assigned into the same or into different clusters
under the true and predicted clusterings.

It has the following entries:

:math:`C_{00}` : number of pairs with both clusterings having the samples
not clustered together

:math:`C_{10}` : number of pairs with the true label clustering having the
samples clustered together but the other clustering not having the samples
clustered together

:math:`C_{01}` : number of pairs with the true label clustering not having
the samples clustered together but the other clustering having the samples
clustered together

:math:`C_{11}` : number of pairs with both clusterings having the samples
clustered together

Considering a pair of samples that is clustered together a positive pair,
then as in binary classification the count of true negatives is
:math:`C_{00}`, false negatives is :math:`C_{10}`, true positives is
:math:`C_{11}` and false positives is :math:`C_{01}`.

Perfectly matching labelings have all non-zero entries on the
diagonal regardless of actual label values::

   >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import pair_confusion_matrix
   >>> pair_confusion_matrix([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1])
   array([[8, 0],
          [0, 4]])

::

   >>> pair_confusion_matrix([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
   array([[8, 0],
          [0, 4]])

Labelings that assign all classes members to the same clusters
are complete but may not always be pure, hence penalized, and
have some off-diagonal non-zero entries::

   >>> pair_confusion_matrix([0, 0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1, 1])
   array([[8, 2],
          [0, 2]])

The matrix is not symmetric::

   >>> pair_confusion_matrix([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 2])
   array([[8, 0],
          [2, 2]])

If classes members are completely split across different clusters, the
assignment is totally incomplete, hence the matrix has all zero
diagonal entries::

   >>> pair_confusion_matrix([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3])
   array([[ 0,  0],
          [12,  0]])
