.. title Scikit-learn for efficient and easier machine learning research
.. Author: Gaël Varoquaux


At INRIA, we use scikit-learn to support leading-edge basic research in many
teams: `Parietal <https://team.inria.fr/parietal/>`_ for neuroimaging, `Lear
<http://lear.inrialpes.fr/>`_ for computer vision, `Visages
<https://www.irisa.fr/visages/index>`_ for medical image analysis, `Privatics
<https://team.inria.fr/privatics>`_ for security. The project is a fantastic
tool to address difficult applications of machine learing in an academic
environment as it is performant and versatile, but all easy-to-use and well
documented, which makes it well suited to grad students.

Building a classifier is typically an iterative process of exploring
the data, selecting the features (the attributes of the data believed
to be predictive in some way), training the models, and finally
evaluating them. For many of these tasks, we relied on the excellent
scikit-learn package for Python.

At Telecom ParisTech, scikit-learn is used for hands-on sessions and home
assignments in introductory and advanced machine learning courses. The classes
are for undergrads and masters students. The great benefit of scikit-learn is
its fast learning curve that allows students to quickly start working on
interesting and motivating problems.

The scikit-learn toolkit is indispensable for the Data Analysis and Management
team at AWeber.  It allows us to do AWesome stuff we would not otherwise have
the time or resources to accomplish. The documentation is excellent, allowing
new engineers to quickly evaluate and apply many different algorithms to our
data. The text feature extraction utilities are useful when working with the
large volume of email content we have at AWeber. The RandomizedPCA
implementation, along with Pipelining and FeatureUnions, allows us to develop
complex machine learning algorithms efficiently and reliably.

Anyone interested in learning more about how AWeber deploys scikit-learn in a
production environment should check out talks from PyData Boston by AWeber's
Michael Becker available at https://github.com/mdbecker/pydata_2013

The combination of consistent APIs, thorough documentation, and top notch
implementation make scikit-learn our favorite machine learning package in
Python. scikit-learn makes doing advanced analysis in Python accessible to
anyone. At Yhat, we make it easy to integrate these models into your production
applications. Thus eliminating the unnecessary dev time encountered
productionizing analytical work.

The Python scikit-learn toolkit is a core tool in the data science
group at Rangespan. Its large collection of well documented models and
algorithms allow our team of data scientists to prototype fast and
quickly iterate to find the right solution to our learning problems.
We find that scikit-learn is not only the right tool for prototyping,
but its careful and well tested implementation give us the confidence
to run scikit-learn models in production.

At Birchbox, we face a range of machine learning problems typical to
E-commerce: product recommendation, user clustering, inventory prediction,
trends detection, etc. Scikit-learn lets us experiment with many models,
especially in the exploration phase of a new project: the data can be passed
around in a consistent way; models are easy to save and reuse; updates keep us
informed of new developments from the pattern discovery research community.
Scikit-learn is an important tool for our team, built the right way in the
right language.

Scikit-learn is our #1 toolkit for all things machine learning
at Bestofmedia. We use it for a variety of tasks (e.g. spam fighting,
ad click prediction, various ranking models) thanks to the varied,
state-of-the-art algorithm implementations packaged into it.
In the lab it accelerates prototyping of complex pipelines. In 
production I can say it has proven to be robust and efficient enough 
to be deployed for business critical components.
