- |Feature| Added support for default metadata routing through
  ``set_config(metadata_request_policy="auto")``. This enables automatic routing
  of common metadata like ``sample_weight`` by default. Consumers (estimators,
  scorers, and CV splitters) can now define instance-level default routing via
  the ``add_auto_request`` method, which complements the existing
  class-level defaults set through ``__metadata_request__*`` attributes.
  Refer to :ref:`metadata_routing_auto_request` for more details.
