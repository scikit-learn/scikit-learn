- :class:`~mixture.GaussianMixture` now consistently operates at `float32`
  precision when fitted with `float32` data to improve training speed and
  memory efficiency. Previously, part of the computation would be implicitly
  cast to `float64`. By :user:`Olivier Grisel <ogrisel>` and :user:`Omar Salman
