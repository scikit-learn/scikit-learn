- scikit-learn 1.8 provides enhanced support for free-threaded CPython (Python 3.13+ without GIL).
  All native extensions have been marked as free-threading compatible, preventing the interpreter 
  from re-enabling the GIL when importing scikit-learn. Additionally, dedicated continuous integration 
  now stress-tests components with concurrent threads to ensure thread safety. For the best 
  free-threading experience, Python 3.14 is recommended when it becomes available.
