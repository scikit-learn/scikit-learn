- A new `mkl` module has been added to scikit-learn, providing estimators and
  transformers for Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL). The module includes three
  classes: `MKLC` (classification), `MKLR` (regression), and `OneClassMKL` (outlier
  detection), which can be used for kernel combination tasks in machine learning.
