- :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_kernels` now supports Array API
  compatible inputs, when the underling `metric` does (the only metric NOT currently
  supported is :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.laplacian_kernel`).
  By :user:`Emily Chen <EmilyXinyi>` and :user:`Lucy Liu <lucyleeow>`.

- :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances` now supports Array API
  compatible inputs, when the underlying `metric` does (currently
  "cosine", "euclidean" and "l2").
