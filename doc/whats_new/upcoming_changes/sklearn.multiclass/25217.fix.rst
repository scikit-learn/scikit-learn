- :class:`multiclass.OutputCodeClassifier` suffers from several bugs.
  Now, the implementation follows the original paper more closely: (i) the
  predictions generated rely on a probablity estimate of each binary
  classifier, (ii) a distance computed between the predictions and the codes in
  the codebook is the L1 distance, and (iii) the codebook is generated with
  sampling without replacement whenever possible to avoid codes collisions.
