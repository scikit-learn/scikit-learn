- The leave-one out errors and model parameters estimated in
  :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV` are now numerically stable in the small `alpha`
  regime for all `gcv_mode` options. The default `auto` option is now equivalent
  to `eigen` and picks the cheaper option: eigendecomposition of the covariance
  (resp Gram) matrix when `n_features <= n_samples` (resp `n_samples >
  n_features`). Furthermore, the `float32` data is no longer upcast to
  `float64` when fitting :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV` as this is no longer
  needed. Users wanting to retain the previous behavior can manually upcast
  their data to `float64` before fitting.
