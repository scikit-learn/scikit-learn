- The leave-one out errors :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV` are now numerically
  stable in the small `alpha` regime for all `gcv_mode` options. The default
  `auto` option is now equivalent to `eigen` and picks the cheaper option:
  eigendecomposition of the covariance (resp Gram) matrix when `n_features <=
  n_samples` (resp `n_samples > n_features`).
