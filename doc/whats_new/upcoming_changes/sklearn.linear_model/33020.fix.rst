- The leave-one out errors and model parameters estimated in
  :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV` are now numerically stable in the small `alpha`
  regime for all `gcv_mode` options. The default `auto` option is now equivalent
  to `eigen` and picks the cheaper option: eigendecomposition of the covariance
  (resp Gram) matrix when `n_features <= n_samples` (resp `n_samples >
  n_features`). When `store_cv_results=True` and `X` is an integer array, the
  `cv_results_` attribute was wrongly coerced to the integer dtype of `X`, it
  now always has a floating dtype.
