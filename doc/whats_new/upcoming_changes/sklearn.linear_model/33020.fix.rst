- The leave-one out errors and model parameters estimated in
  :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV` and :class:`linear_model.RidgeClassifierCV` when
  `cv=None` are now numerically stable in the small `alpha` regime. The default
  `auto` option is now equivalent to `eigen` and picks the cheaper option:
  eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix when `n_features <= n_samples`,
  respectively of the Gram matrix when `n_samples > n_features`. When
  `store_cv_results=True` and `X` is an integer array, the `cv_results_`
  attribute was wrongly coerced to the integer dtype of `X`, it now always has a
  float dtype.
