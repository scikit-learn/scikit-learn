- `PassiveAggressiveClassifier` and `PassiveAggressiveRegressor` are deprecated
  and will be removed in 1.10. Equivalent estimators are available with `SGDClassifier`
  and `SGDRegressor`, both of which expose the options `learning_rate="pa1"` and
  `"pa2"`. The parameter `eta0` can be used to specify the aggressiveness parameter of
  the Passive-Aggressive-Algorithms, called C in the reference paper.
