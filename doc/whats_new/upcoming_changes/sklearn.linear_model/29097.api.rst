- `PassiveAggressiveClassifier` and `PassiveAggressiveRegressor` are deprecated
  and will be removed in 1.10. Equivalent estimators are available with `SGDClassifier`
  and `SGDRegressor`, both of which expose the options `learning_rate="pa1"` and
  `"pa2"` as well as the new parameter `PA_C` for the aggressiveness parameter of the
  Passive-Aggressive-Algorithms.
