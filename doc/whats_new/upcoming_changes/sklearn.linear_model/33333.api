- The default value of the `scoring` parameter in
  :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` will change in version 1.11 from `None`,
  i.e. accuracy, to `"neg_log_loss"`. This is a much better default scoring function
  as it aligns with the log loss that logistic regression is minimizing
  (with regularization).
  For the meantime, you can silence the warning for this change by explicitly passing
  a value to `scoring`.
