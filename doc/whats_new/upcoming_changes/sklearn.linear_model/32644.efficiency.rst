- :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` with `solver="lbfgs"` now estimates
  the gradient of the loss at `float32` precision when fitted with `float32`
  data to improve training speed and memory efficiency. Previously, the input
  data would be implicitly cast to `float64`. If you relied on the previous
  behavior for numerical reasons, you can explicitly cast your data to
  `float64` before fitting to restore it.
