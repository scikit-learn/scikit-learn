- Fixed a bug with `solver="newton-cholesky"` on multi-class problems in
  :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` and in
  :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` when used with `warm_start=True`. The bug
  appeared either with `fit_intercept=True` or with `penalty=None` (both resulting in
  unpenalized parameters for the solver). The coefficients and intercepts of the last
  class as provided by warm start were partially wrongly overwritten by zero.
