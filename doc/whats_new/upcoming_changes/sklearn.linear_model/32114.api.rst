- :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` got a new parameter
  `use_legacy_attributes` to control the types and shapes of the fitted attributes
  `C_`, `l1_ratio_`, `coefs_paths_`, `scores_` and `n_iter_`.
  The current default value `True` keeps the legacy behaviour. If `False` then
    - `C_` is a float
    - `l1_ratio_` is a float
    - `coefs_paths_` is an ndarray of shape
      (n_folds, n_l1_ratios, n_cs, n_classes, n_features)
      For binary problems (n_classes=2), the 2nd last dimension is 1.
    - `scores_` is an ndarray of shape (n_folds, n_l1_ratios, n_cs)
    - `n_iter_` is an ndarray of shape (n_folds, n_l1_ratios, n_cs)

  In version 1.10, the default will change to `False` and `use_legacy_attributes` will
  be deprecated. In 1.12 `use_legacy_attributes` will be remove.
