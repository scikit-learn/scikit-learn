  :class:`linear_model.Lasso`, :class:`linear_model.LassoCV` as well as
  :func:`linear_model.lasso_path` and :func:`linear_model.enet_path` now implement
  gap safe screening rules in the coordinate descent solver for dense `X` and
  `precompute=False` or `"auto"` with `n_samples < n_features`.
  The speedup of fitting time is particularly pronounced (10-times is possible) when
  computing regularization paths like the \*CV-variants of the above estimators do.
  There is now an additional check of the stopping criterion before entering the main
  loop of descent steps. As the stopping criterion requires the computation of the dual
  gap, the screening happens whenever the dual gap is computed.
