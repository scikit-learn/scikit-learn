- Fix the convergence criteria for SGD models, to avoid premature convergence when
  `tol != None`. This primarily impacts :class:`SGDOneClassSVM` but also affects
  :class:`SGDClassifier` and :class:`SGDRegressor`. Before this fix, only the loss
  function without penalty was used as the convergence check, whereas now, the full
  objective with regularization is used.
