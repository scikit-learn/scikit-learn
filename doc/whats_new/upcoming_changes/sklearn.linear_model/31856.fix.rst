- Fix the convergence criteria for SGD models,
  to avoid premature convergence when `tol != None`.
  Primarily affects :class:`SGDOneClassSVM`, also affects :class:`SGDClassifier`, :class:`SGDRegressor`.
  Before this fix, only the loss function without penalty was used as convergence check.
  Now, the full objective with regularization is used.
  For instance, this bug caused `SGDOneClassSVM` to often converge too early.
