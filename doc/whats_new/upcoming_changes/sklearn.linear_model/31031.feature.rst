- :class:`linear_model.Ridge` now supports both single bool and list of bools for the `positive` parameter
  to enforce non-negativity constraints on the coefficients.
  Single bool is equivalent to passing a list of bools with all elements set to the same value.
  List of bools allows to specify non-negativity constraints for each target variable independently.
