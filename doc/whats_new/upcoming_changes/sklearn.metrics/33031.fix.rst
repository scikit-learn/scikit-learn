Fix confusion_matrix crash with empty sample_weight
---------------------------------------------------

Fixed a crash in :func:`sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix` when
``sample_weight`` was provided as an empty array while ``y_true`` and
``y_pred`` were non-empty. An empty ``sample_weight`` is now treated as
all-zero weights.
