- :class:`metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay` now correctly computes
  ``prevalence_pos_label`` when ``y_true`` is a non-NumPy array-like (e.g.
  PyTorch tensor or plain list). Previously, using ``Counter`` caused incorrect
  chance level lines when array elements did not match ``pos_label`` by
  identity.
