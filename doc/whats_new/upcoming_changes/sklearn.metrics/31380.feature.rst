The new functiom :func:`metrics.rec_curve` computes the Regression Error Characteristic
(REC) curve of error tolerances vs the fraction of samples below the tolerance (the CDF
of the regression errors). Suggested in the ICML'03 paper "Regression error
characteristic curves" by Bi and Bennett as the regression-variant of the ROC curve.

The new class :class:`metrics.RecCurveDisplay` visualizes the REC curves.
