- :func:`sklearn.metrics.d2_pinball_score` and `d2_absolute_error_score` now always
  use the `"averaged_inverted_cdf"` quantile interpolation method, both with and
  without sample weights. Previously, the `"linear"` percentile method was used only
  for the unweighted case leading the surprising discrepancies when comparing the
  results with unit weights. Note that all quantile interpolation methods are 
  equivalent in the large sample limit, but this fix can cause score value changes
  on small evaluation sets (without weights).
