:class:`manifold.MDS` will switch to use `n_init=1` and `eps=1e-6` by default,
starting from version 1.9. The convergence criterion has been adjusted to
make sense for both metric and non-metric MDS and to follow the reference
R implementation. The formula for normalized stress was adjusted to follow
the original definition by Kruskal.
