- A class variable `n_classes` is added to :class:`inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay`
  which extracts the number of classes from the estimator.
  Based on this, `multiclass_colors` is now also used for multiclass plotting when
  `response_method="predict"`, and the classes are plotted one by one (as it is also
  done for the other response methods). This also fixes (part of) the known bug that not
  all classes were shown in distinct colours for problems with more than 7 classes.
