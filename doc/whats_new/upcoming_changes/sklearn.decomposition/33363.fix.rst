- Fix :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation` perplexity
  normalization so the topic-word prior term is scaled by the fitted component mass
  instead of the evaluation-document word count. This removes spurious large changes
  when evaluating perplexity on small datasets and improves consistency with
  :meth:`~sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation.score`.
