- :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA` now have a `svd_solver` parameter that supports
  `"full"` (full SVD, the original behavior) and `"arpack"` (truncated SVD using
  ARPACK). In particular, the `"arpack"` solver will not densify sparse inputs as the
  `"full"` solver does, thus being faster and more memory efficient. When used on sparse
  data like :func:`datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`, this can lead to speed-ups
  of TODO (single threaded) and TODO lower memory usage. Moreover, the
  :meth:`~decomposition.IncrementalPCA.partial_fit` method now supports sparse inputs
  when using the `"arpack"` solver. By :user:`Yao Xiao <Charlie-XIAO>`.
