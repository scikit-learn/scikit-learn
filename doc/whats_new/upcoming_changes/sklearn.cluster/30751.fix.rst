- :class:`cluster.MiniBatchKMeans` now correctly handles sample weights
    during fitting. When sample weights are not None, mini-batch
    indices are created by sub-sampling with replacement using the
    normalized sample weights as probabilities. Sample weights are
    then set to one in the mini-batch step calculation to avoid
    double weighting.
