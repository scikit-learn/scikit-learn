Added group-aware functionality to :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit`.
The ``groups`` parameter now allows for proper cross-validation of time series data 
with multiple groups, ensuring temporal order is preserved within each group while 
maintaining the time-based splitting behavior.
