- Sparse update: As part of the SciPy change from spmatrix to sparray, all
  internal use of sparse now supports both sparray and spmatrix.
  All manipulations of sparse objects should work for either spmatrix or sparray.
  This is pass 1 of a migration toward sparray (see
  `SciPy migration to sparray <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.migration_to_sparray.html>`_
