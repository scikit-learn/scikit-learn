- , :class:`impute.IterativeImputer`, :class:`feature_selection.RFE`,
  :class:`feature_selection.RFECV`, :class:`feature_selection.SelectFromModel`, and
  :class:`feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector` now properly route metadata when
  used inside a Pipeline object. Prior to this fix, when sample_weight was provided in
  the Pipeline's `**fit_params`, the `sample_weight` was not being routed to the feature
  selector's estimator. In certain cases, this would result in incorrect feature
  selection. By :user:`Kyle Schluns <kschluns>`
