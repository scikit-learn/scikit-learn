- The :func:`fit()` method of :class:`feature_selection.RFE` and :class:`feature_selection.RFECV`
  now has optional parameters `X_val` and `y_val` to provide validation samples.
  These validation samples are passed to :attr:`importance_getter` when a callable
  that can accept them. This allows using methods that need external data to be accurate
  like :func:`permutation_importance`.
