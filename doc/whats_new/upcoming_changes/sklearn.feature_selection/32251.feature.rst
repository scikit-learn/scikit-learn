- :class:`feature_selection.RFE` and :class:`feature_selection.RFECV`
  now support the use of :func:`permutation_importance` as an :attr:`importance_getter`.
  When a callable, and when possible, the :attr:`importance_getter` is passed
  :attr:`feature_indices` along with the fitted estimator.
  The attribute :attr:`feature_indices` stores the index of the features from the full dataset
  that have not been eliminated yet.
  This allows methods that need a test set, like :func:`permutation_importance`, to know which
  features to use in their predictions.
