- :class:`dummy.DummyClassifier` now supports a new strategy "uniform-proba" that
  generates random probability distributions for each sample using a Dirichlet
  distribution with all concentration parameters set to 1. This results in uniformly
  distributed probability vectors that sum to 1 for each sample.
