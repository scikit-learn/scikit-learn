- :func:`utils.check_feature_names` and :func:`utils.check_n_features` are now
  public functions (previously ``_check_feature_names`` and ``_check_n_features``).
  These functions are useful for custom estimators to validate feature counts
  and feature names consistently with scikit-learn's conventions. The old private
  names are deprecated and will be removed in version 1.9.
