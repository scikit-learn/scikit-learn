- Fixed a spurious warning that could occur when passing ``estimator.classes_``
  or similar arrays with many unique values to classification utilities.
  The warning came from :func:`sklearn.utils.multiclass.type_of_target` and has
  now been suppressed when the input is not a true target vector.
  The warning message was: "The number of unique classes is greater than 50%
  of the number of samples."
  This could appear in tools that internally validate classification outputs,
  such as :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV`,
  :func:`~sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`,
  :func:`~sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`,
  :class:`~sklearn.multioutput.MultiOutputClassifier`,
  and :class:`~sklearn.calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV`.
