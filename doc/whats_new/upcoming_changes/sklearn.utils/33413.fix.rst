- Fixed repeated third-party deprecation warnings in process-based parallel
  execution. When :class:`utils.parallel.Parallel` propagates warning filters
  to workers, warning categories are now restored without implicit imports of
  third-party modules. This avoids repeated warning noise such as
  ``pkg_resources is deprecated as an API`` in some workflows.
