- :class:`calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV` now supports the Array API for
  ``method="sigmoid"`` and ``method="isotonic"`` in addition to the
  previously supported ``method="temperature"``. Predictions are converted to
  NumPy internally for calibration fitting and prediction, while the
  underlying estimator can still operate on Array API arrays.
