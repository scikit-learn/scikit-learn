- Fixed feature-wise NaN detection for trees and tree-based model.
  Features could be seen as NaN-free for some very edge-casy patterns
  which lead to not consider splits with NaNs on the left for those features.
  This affects:
  - :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`
  - :class:`tree.ExtraTreeRegressor`
  - :class:`ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`
  - :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor`
