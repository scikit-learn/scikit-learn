- Fixed splitting logic during training in :class:`tree.DecisionTree*`
  (and consequently in :class:`ensemble.RandomForest*`)
  for nodes containing near-constant feature values and missing values.
  Beforehand, trees were cut short if a constant feature was found,
  even if there was more splitting that could be done on the basis of missing values.
