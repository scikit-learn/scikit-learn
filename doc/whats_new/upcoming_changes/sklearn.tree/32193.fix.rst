- Fixed feature-wise NaN detection in trees.
  Features could be seen as NaN-free for some edge-case patterns, which led to
  not considering splits with NaNs assigned to the left node for those features.
  This affects:
  - :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`
  - :class:`tree.ExtraTreeRegressor`
  - :class:`ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`
  - :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor`
