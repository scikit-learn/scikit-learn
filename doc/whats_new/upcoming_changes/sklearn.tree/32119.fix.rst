- Fix calculation of nodes impurity in :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`,
  :class:`ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`,  :class:`ExtraTreesRegressor` and
  :class:`ExtraTreesRegressor` when missing values are present for poisson criterion.
  Poisson criterion was returning invalid impurities (including negative values)
  when missing values were present.
