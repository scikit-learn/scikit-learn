- :class:`tree.Tree` now has a method that allows passing test samples
  to compute a test score and feature importance measure.
  The public method `compute_unbiased_feature_importance` is used in forest
  estimators to compute out-of-bag predictions and unbiased feature importance
  measures but can be used in any tree ensemble.
