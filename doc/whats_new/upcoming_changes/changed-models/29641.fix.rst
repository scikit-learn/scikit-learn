- :class:`HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`
   now calculate bin edges differently when sample_weights=None. When the
   number of distinct feature values is less than the specified max_bins,
   the edges are calculated using a sliding window of shape 2. Otherwise,
   percentile values calculated using averaged inverted cdf are used as
   the bin edges. N evenly spaced percentiles are selected going from
   0-100, where N=max_bins. Percentiles are then reduced to their distinct
   values to avoid repeated bin edge values.
