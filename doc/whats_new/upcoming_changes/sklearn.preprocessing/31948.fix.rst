- :class:`preprocessing.PowerTransformer` and :class:`preprocessing.QuantileTransformer` now use
  check_array for inverse_transform, instead of _check_input.
  This fixes the following UserWarning:
  X has feature names, but PowerTransformer was fitted without feature names.
  X has feature names, but QuantileTransformer was fitted without feature names.
