- :class:`ensemble.BaggingClassifier`, :class:`ensemble.BaggingRegressor` and
  :class:`ensemble.IsolationForest` now use `sample_weight` to draw the samples
  instead of forwarding them multiplied by a uniformly sampled mask to the
  underlying estimators. Furthermore, when `max_samples` is a float, it is now
  interpreted as a fraction of `sample_weight.sum()` instead of `X.shape[0]`.
  The new default `max_samples=None` draws `X.shape[0]` samples, irrespective
  of `sample_weight`.
