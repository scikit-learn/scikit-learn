  `"friedman_mse"` criterion was computing incorrectly scaled impurity values,
  leading to unexpected trees in some cases. The implementation now uses
  `"squared_error"`, which is exactly equivalent to `"friedman_mse"` up to
  floating-point error discrepancies but computes correct impurity values.
