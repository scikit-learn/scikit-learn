- :class:`ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and
  :class:`ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` are faster, roughly
  `1 - 1/n_features` faster to before with a single thread. The estimators now reuse
  the parent's node histogram for the single feature that was split on, i.e. just copy
  the parent's node histogram values for the corresponding bins.
