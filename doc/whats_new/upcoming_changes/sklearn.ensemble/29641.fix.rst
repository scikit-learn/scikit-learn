- Fixed the way :class:`ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and
  `ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` compute their bin edges to properly and
  consistently handle :term:`sample_weight`. When `sample_weights=None` is
  passed to `fit` and the number of distinct feature values is less than the
  specified `max_bins`, the edges are calculated using a sliding window of shape
  2. Otherwise, the bin edges are set to `max_bins` and weight-aware quantiles
  computed using the averaged inverted CDF method. If `n_samples` is larger than
  the `subsample` parameter, the weights are instead used to subsample the data
  (with replacement) and the bin edges are set using unweighted quantiles of the
  subsampled data. Furthermore, duplicate bin edges are trimmed. By
