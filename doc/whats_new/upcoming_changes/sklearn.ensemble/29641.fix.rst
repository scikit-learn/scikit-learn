- :class:`BaseHistGradientBoosting` now uses sample weights correctly
  when calculating bin edges. When `n_samples` is greater than 2e5 and
  sample weights is not None, subsampling is done with replacement using
  the normalised sample weights as probabilities. Bin edges are then
  calculated on the subsampled data. When `n_samples` is less than 2e5
  and sample weights is not None a weighted percentile calculation is
  performed to calculate bin edges.
