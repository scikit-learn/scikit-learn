- Fixed the way :class:`ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and
  `ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` compute their bin edges to properly and
  consistently handle :term:`sample_weight`. When `sample_weights=None` is
  passed to `fit` and the number of distinct feature values is less than the
  specified `max_bins`, the edges are still set to midpoints between consecutive
  feature values. Otherwise, the bin edges are set to weight-aware quantiles
  computed using the averaged inverted CDF method. If `n_samples` is larger than
  the `subsample` parameter, the weights are instead used to subsample the data
  (with replacement) and the bin edges are set using unweighted quantiles of the
  subsampled data. By
