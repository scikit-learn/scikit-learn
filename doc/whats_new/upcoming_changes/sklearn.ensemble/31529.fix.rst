- :class:`ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`, :class:`ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`,
  :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier` and :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor`
  now use `sample_weight` to draw the samples instead of forwarding them
  multiplied by a uniformly sampled mask to the underlying estimators.
  Furthermore, `max_samples` is now interpreted as a fraction of
  `sample_weight.sum()` instead of `X.shape[0]` when passed as a float.
  In particular, when `max_sample=None`, each tree is fitted with
  `sample_weight.sum()` data points instead of `X.shape[0]` data points
  as previously.
