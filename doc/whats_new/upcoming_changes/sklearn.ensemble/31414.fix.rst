- :class:`ensemble.BaggingClassifier`, :class:`ensemble.BaggingRegressor`
  and :class:`ensemble.IsolationForest` now use `sample_weight` to draw
  the samples instead of forwarding them multiplied by a uniformly sampled
  mask to the underlying estimators. Furthermore, `max_samples` is now
  interpreted as a fraction of `sample_weight.sum()` instead of `X.shape[0]`
  when passed as a float.
