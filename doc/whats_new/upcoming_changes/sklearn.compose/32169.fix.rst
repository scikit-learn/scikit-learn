- :class:`~sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` now raises a clear error
  when input :class:`pandas.DataFrame` objects have integer column names.
  Integer names are ambiguous, as they can be interpreted both as
  column positions and as column labels. Users should cast column names
  to strings, e.g. ``df.columns = df.columns.astype(str)``.
