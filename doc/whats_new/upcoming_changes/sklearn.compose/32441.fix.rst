- Internal validation logic across several modules has been updated to use
  :func:`~sklearn.utils.validation.validate_data` instead of the internal
  `_check_n_features` and `_check_feature_names` functions when both were used
  together. This improves consistency with the common estimator validation API.

- Made the :func: `check_n_features` and `check_feature_names` public across the project.
