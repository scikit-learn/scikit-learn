- :func:`compose.make_column_selector` now supports selecting columns based on
  their cardinality (number of unique values) with the ``cardinality`` and
  ``cardinality_threshold`` parameters. This enables users to differentiate treatment
  of categorical columns based on their cardinality, such as one-hot encoding
  low cardinality columns and target-encoding high cardinality columns.
