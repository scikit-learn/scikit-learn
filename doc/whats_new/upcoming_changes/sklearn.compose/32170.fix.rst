- Using pandas DataFrames with integer column names in
  :class:`~sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` now issues a
  :class:`UserWarning`. Integer column names are ambiguous because
  scikit-learn interprets integers as column positions. When integer
  column names are detected, they are **ignored** and columns are
  selected based on their **position**. Please cast column names to
  strings (e.g. ``df.columns = df.columns.astype(str)``) to ensure
  correct feature name validation and selection.
