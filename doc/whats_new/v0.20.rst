cannot assure that this list is complete.)

Changelog
---------

Support for Python 3.3 has been officially dropped.

New features
............

Classifiers and regressors

- :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
  :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` now support early stopping
  via ``n_iter_no_change``, ``validation_fraction`` and ``tol``. :issue:`7071`
  by `Raghav RV`_

- Added :class:`naive_bayes.ComplementNB`, which implements the Complement
  Naive Bayes classifier described in Rennie et al. (2003).
  :issue:`8190` by :user:`Michael A. Alcorn <airalcorn2>`.

Preprocessing

- Added :class:`preprocessing.CategoricalEncoder`, which allows to encode
  categorical features as a numeric array, either using a one-hot (or
  dummy) encoding scheme or by converting to ordinal integers.
  Compared to the existing :class:`OneHotEncoder`, this new class handles
  encoding of all feature types (also handles string-valued features) and
  derives the categories based on the unique values in the features instead of
  the maximum value in the features. :issue:`9151` by
  :user:`Vighnesh Birodkar <vighneshbirodkar>` and `Joris Van den Bossche`_.

- Added :class:`preprocessing.PowerTransformer`, which implements the Box-Cox
  power transformation, allowing users to map data from any distribution to a
  Gaussian distribution. This is useful as a variance-stabilizing transformation
  in situations where normality and homoscedasticity are desirable.
  :issue:`10210` by :user:`Eric Chang <ericchang00>` and
  :user:`Maniteja Nandana <maniteja123>`.


Model evaluation

- Added the :func:`metrics.balanced_accuracy_score` metric and a corresponding
  ``'balanced_accuracy'`` scorer for binary classification.
  :issue:`8066` by :user:`xyguo` and :user:`Aman Dalmia <dalmia>`.

- Added :class:`multioutput.RegressorChain` for multi-target
  regression. :issue:`9257` by :user:`Kumar Ashutosh <thechargedneutron>`.

- Added the :class:`preprocessing.TransformedTargetRegressor` which transforms
  the target y before fitting a regression model. The predictions are mapped
  back to the original space via an inverse transform. :issue:`9041` by
  `Andreas Müller`_ and :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

Enhancements
............

Classifiers and regressors

- In :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor`, method ``predict``
  is faster when using ``return_std=True`` in particular more when called
  several times in a row. :issue:`9234` by :user:`andrewww <andrewww>`
  and :user:`Minghui Liu <minghui-liu>`.

- Add `named_estimators_` parameter in
  :class:`ensemble.VotingClassifier` to access fitted
  estimators. :issue:`9157` by :user:`Herilalaina Rakotoarison <herilalaina>`.

- Add `var_smoothing` parameter in
  :class:`naive_bayes.GaussianNB` to give a precise control over
  variances calculation. :issue:`9681` by :user:`Dmitry Mottl <Mottl>`.

- Add `n_iter_no_change` parameter in
  :class:`neural_network.BaseMultilayerPerceptron`,
  :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor`, and
  :class:`neural_network.MLPClassifier` to give control over
  maximum number of epochs to not meet ``tol`` improvement.
  :issue:`9456` by :user:`Nicholas Nadeau <nnadeau>`.

- A parameter ``check_inverse`` was added to
  :class:`preprocessing.FunctionTransformer` to ensure that ``func`` and
  ``inverse_func`` are the inverse of each other.
  :issue:`9399` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- Add `sample_weight` parameter to the fit method of
  :class:`linear_model.BayesianRidge` for weighted linear regression.
  :issue:`10111` by :user:`Peter St. John <pstjohn>`.

- :class:`dummy.DummyClassifier` and :class:`dummy.DummyRegresssor` now
  only require X to be an object with finite length or shape.
  :issue:`9832` by :user:`Vrishank Bhardwaj <vrishank97>`.

Model evaluation and meta-estimators

- A scorer based on :func:`metrics.brier_score_loss` is also available.
  :issue:`9521` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

- The default of ``iid`` parameter of :class:`model_selection.GridSearchCV`
  and :class:`model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV` will change from ``True`` to
  ``False`` in version 0.22 to correspond to the standard definition of
  cross-validation, and the parameter will be removed in version 0.24
  altogether. This parameter is of greatest practical significance where the
  sizes of different test sets in cross-validation were very unequal, i.e. in
  group-based CV strategies. :issue:`9085` by :user:`Laurent Direr <ldirer>`
  and `Andreas Müller`_.

Metrics

- :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score` now supports binary ``y_true`` other than
  ``{0, 1}`` or ``{-1, 1}``. :issue:`9828` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

Linear, kernelized and related models

- Deprecate ``random_state`` parameter in :class:`svm.OneClassSVM` as the
  underlying implementation is not random.
  :issue:`9497` by :user:`Albert Thomas <albertcthomas>`.

Miscellaneous

- Add ``filename`` attribute to datasets that have a CSV file.
  :issue:`9101` by :user:`alex-33 <alex-33>`
  and :user:`Maskani Filali Mohamed <maskani-moh>`.

Bug fixes
.........

Classifiers and regressors

- Fixed a bug in :class:`isotonic.IsotonicRegression` which incorrectly
  combined weights when fitting a model to data involving points with
  identical X values.
  :issue:`9432` by :user:`Dallas Card <dallascard>`

- Fixed a bug in :class:`neural_network.BaseMultilayerPerceptron`,
  :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor`, and
  :class:`neural_network.MLPClassifier` with new ``n_iter_no_change``
  parameter now at 10 from previously hardcoded 2.
  :issue:`9456` by :user:`Nicholas Nadeau <nnadeau>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor` where fitting
  quit unexpectedly early due to local minima or fluctuations.
  :issue:`9456` by :user:`Nicholas Nadeau <nnadeau>`

- Fixed a bug in :class:`naive_bayes.GaussianNB` which incorrectly raised
  error for prior list which summed to 1.
  :issue:`10005` by :user:`Gaurav Dhingra <gxyd>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`linear_model.OrthogonalMatchingPursuit` that was
  broken when setting ``normalize=False``.
  :issue:`10071` by `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`linear_model.ARDRegression` which caused incorrectly
  updated estimates for the standard deviation and the coefficients.
  :issue:`10153` by :user:`Jörg Döpfert <jdoepfert>`.

- Fixed a bug when fitting :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` or
  :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` with ``warm_start=True`` which
  previously raised a segmentation fault due to a non-conversion of CSC matrix
  into CSR format expected by ``decision_function``. Similarly, Fortran-ordered
  arrays are converted to C-ordered arrays in the dense case. :issue:`9991` by
  :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`neighbors.NearestNeighbors` where fitting a
  NearestNeighbors model fails when a) the distance metric used is a
  callable and b) the input to the NearestNeighbors model is sparse.
  :issue:`9579` by :user:`Thomas Kober <tttthomasssss>`.

Decomposition, manifold learning and clustering

- Fix for uninformative error in :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA`:
  now an error is raised if the number of components is larger than the
  chosen batch size. The ``n_components=None`` case was adapted accordingly.
  :issue:`6452`. By :user:`Wally Gauze <wallygauze>`.

- Fixed a bug where the ``partial_fit`` method of
  :class:`decomposition.IncrementalPCA` used integer division instead of float
  division on Python 2 versions. :issue:`9492` by
  :user:`James Bourbeau <jrbourbeau>`.

- Fixed a bug where the ``fit`` method of
  :class:`cluster.AffinityPropagation` stored cluster
  centers as 3d array instead of 2d array in case of non-convergence. For the
  same class, fixed undefined and arbitrary behavior in case of training data
  where all samples had equal similarity.
  :issue:`9612`. By :user:`Jonatan Samoocha <jsamoocha>`.

- In :class:`decomposition.PCA` selecting a n_components parameter greater than
  the number of samples now raises an error.
  Similarly, the ``n_components=None`` case now selects the minimum of
  n_samples and n_features. :issue:`8484`. By :user:`Wally Gauze <wallygauze>`.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`datasets.fetch_kddcup99`, where data were not properly
  shuffled. :issue:`9731` by `Nicolas Goix`_.

- Fixed a bug in :class:`decomposition.PCA` where users will get unexpected error
  with large datasets when ``n_components='mle'`` on Python 3 versions.
  :issue:`9886` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

- Fixed a bug when setting parameters on meta-estimator, involving both a
  wrapped estimator and its parameter. :issue:`9999` by :user:`Marcus Voss
  <marcus-voss>` and `Joel Nothman`_.

- ``k_means`` now gives a warning, if the number of distinct clusters found
  is smaller than ``n_clusters``. This may occur when the number of distinct
  points in the data set is actually smaller than the number of cluster one is
  looking for. :issue:`10059` by :user:`Christian Braune <christianbraune79>`.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`datasets.make_circles`, where no odd number of data
  points could be generated. :issue:`10037` by :user:`Christian Braune
  <christianbraune79>`_.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`cluster.spectral_clustering` where the normalization of
  the spectrum was using a division instead of a multiplication. :issue:`8129`
  by :user:`Jan Margeta <jmargeta>`, :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`,
  and :user:`Devansh D. <devanshdalal>`.

Metrics

- Fixed a bug due to floating point error in :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score` with
  non-integer sample weights. :issue:`9786` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

- Fixed a bug where :func:`metrics.roc_curve` sometimes starts on y-axis instead
  of (0, 0), which is inconsistent with the document and other implementations.
  Note that this will not influence the result from :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score`
  :issue:`10093` by :user:`alexryndin <alexryndin>`
  and :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

Neighbors

- Fixed a bug so ``predict`` in :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsRegressor` can
  handle empty neighbor set when using non uniform weights. Also raises a new
  warning when no neighbors are found for samples.  :issue:`9655` by
  :user:`Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen <abjer>`.

Feature Extraction

- Fixed a bug in :func:`feature_extraction.image.extract_patches_2d` which would
  throw an exception if ``max_patches`` was greater than or equal to the number
  of all possible patches rather than simply returning the number of possible
  patches. :issue:`10100` by :user:`Varun Agrawal <varunagrawal>`

- Fixed a bug in :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`,
  :class:`feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`,
  :class:`feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer` to support 64 bit sparse
  array indexing necessary to process large datasets with more than 2·10⁹ tokens
  (words or n-grams). :issue:`9147` by :user:`Claes-Fredrik Mannby <mannby>`
  and `Roman Yurchak`_.

API changes summary
-------------------

Linear, kernelized and related models

- Deprecate ``random_state`` parameter in :class:`svm.OneClassSVM` as the
  underlying implementation is not random.
  :issue:`9497` by :user:`Albert Thomas <albertcthomas>`.

- Deprecate ``positive=True`` option in :class:`linear_model.Lars` as the
  underlying implementation is broken. Use :class:`linear_model.Lasso` instead.
  :issue:`9837` by `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

Metrics

- Deprecate ``reorder`` parameter in :func:`metrics.auc` as it's no longer required
  for :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score`. Moreover using ``reorder=True`` can hide bugs
  due to floating point error in the input.
  :issue:`9851` by :user:`Hanmin Qin <qinhanmin2014>`.

Cluster

- Deprecate ``pooling_func`` unused parameter in
  :class:`cluster.AgglomerativeClustering`. :issue:`9875` by :user:`Kumar Ashutosh
  <thechargedneutron>`.

Changes to estimator checks
---------------------------

- Allow tests in :func:`estimator_checks.check_estimator` to test functions
  that accept pairwise data.
  :issue:`9701` by :user:`Kyle Johnson <gkjohns>`

- Allow :func:`estimator_checks.check_estimator` to check that there is no
  private settings apart from parameters during estimator initialization.
  :issue:`9378` by :user:`Herilalaina Rakotoarison <herilalaina>`
