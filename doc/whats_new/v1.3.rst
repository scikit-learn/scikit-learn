Version 1.3.0
=============

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

- |Enhancement| The `fit_transform` method of :class:`decomposition.DictionaryLearning`
  is more efficient but may produce different results as in previous versions when
  `transform_algorithm` is not the same as `fit_algorithm` and the number of iterations
  is small. :pr:`24871` by :user:`Omar Salman <OmarManzoor>`.

- |Fix| The `categories_` attribute of :class:`preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` now
  always contains an array of `object`s when using predefined categories that
  are strings. Predefined categories encoded as bytes will no longer work
  with `X` encoded as strings. :pr:`25174` by :user:`Tim Head <betatim>`.

Changes impacting all modules
-----------------------------

- |Enhancement| All scikit-learn estimators now save the scikit-learn version
  with which they have been pickled into a private attribute,
  `__sklearn_pickle_version__`. This allows access to this information without
  having to parse the warning message.
  :pr:`22094` by :user:`Gawein Le Goff <Edern76>`.

Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

:mod:`sklearn.cluster`
......................

- |API| The `sample_weight` parameter in `predict` for
  :meth:`cluster.KMeans.predict` and :meth:`cluster.MiniBatchKMeans.predict`
  is now deprecated and will be removed in v1.5.
  :pr:`25251` by :user:`Gleb Levitski <glevv>`.

:mod:`sklearn.decomposition`
............................
- |Enhancement| :class:`decomposition.DictionaryLearning` now accepts the parameter
  `callback` for consistency with the function :func:`decomposition.dict_learning`.
  :pr:`24871` by :user:`Omar Salman <OmarManzoor>`.

:mod:`sklearn.ensemble`
.......................
- |Feature| Compute a custom out-of-bag score by passing a callable to
  :class:`ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`, :class:`ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`,
  :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier` and :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor`.
  :pr:`25177` by :user:`Tim Head <betatim>`.

:mod:`sklearn.model_selection`
..............................
- |Fix| :func:`model_selection.cross_validate` with multimetric scoring in
  case of some failing scorers the non-failing scorers now returns proper
  scores instead of `error_score` values.
  :pr:`23101` by :user:`András Simon <simonandras>` and `Thomas Fan`_.

:mod:`sklearn.naive_bayes`
..........................
- |Fix| :class:`naive_bayes.GaussianNB` does not raise anymore a `ZeroDivisionError`
  when the provided `sample_weight` reduces the problem to a single class in `fit`.
  :pr:`24140` by :user:`Jonathan Ohayon <Johayon>` and :user:`Chiara Marmo <cmarmo>`.

:mod:`sklearn.pipeline`
.......................
- |Feature| :class:`pipeline.FeatureUnion` can now use indexing notation (e.g.
  `feature_union["scalar"]`) to access transformers by name. :pr:`25093` by
  `Thomas Fan`_.

:mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`
............................
- |Enhancement| Added support for `sample_weight` in
  :class:`preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer`. This allows specifying the parameter
  `sample_weight` for each sample to be used while fitting. The option is only
  available when `strategy` is set to `quantile`.
  :pr:`24935` by :user:`Seladus <seladus>`, :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`, and
  :user:`Dea María Léon <deamarialeon>`.
