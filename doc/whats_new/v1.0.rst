Version 1.0.0
=============

**In Development**


.. include:: changelog_legend.inc

Put the changes in their relevant module.

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.



Details are listed in the changelog below.

(While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we
cannot assure that this list is complete.)


Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

:mod:`sklearn.feature_extraction`
.................................

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in class:`feature_extraction.HashingVectorizer` where some
  input strings would result in negative indices in the transformed data.
  :pr:`19035` by :user:`Liu Yu <ly648499246>`.

:mod:`sklearn.tree`
...................

- |Enhancement| Add `fontname` argument in :func:`tree.export_graphviz`
  for non-English characters. :pr:`18959` by :user:`Zero <Zeroto521>`
  and :user:`wstates <wstates>`.

:mod:`sklearn.cluster`
......................

- |Efficiency| The "k-means++" initialization of :class:`cluster.KMeans` and
  :class:`cluster.MiniBatchKMeans` is now faster, especially in multicore
  settings. :pr:`19002` by :user:`Jon Crall <Erotemic>` and
  :user:`Jérémie du Boisberranger <jeremiedbb>`.

- |Efficiency| :class:`cluster.KMeans` with `algorithm='elkan'` is now faster
  in multicore settings. :pr:`19052` by
  :user:`Yusuke Nagasaka <YusukeNagasaka>`.

:mod:`sklearn.linear_model`
...........................

- |Fix| :meth:`ElasticNet.fit` no longer modifies `sample_weight` in place.
  :pr:`19055` by `Thomas Fan`_.

- |Enhancement| Validate user-supplied gram matrix passed to linear models
  via the `precompute` argument. :pr:`19004` by :user:`Adam Midvidy <amidvidy>`.

:mod:`sklearn.naive_bayes`
..........................

- |API| The attribute ``sigma_`` is now deprecated in
  :class:`naive_bayes.GaussianNB` and will be removed in 1.2.
  Use ``var_`` instead.
  :pr:`18842` by :user:`Hong Shao Yang <hongshaoyang>`.
