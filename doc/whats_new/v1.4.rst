Version 1.4.0
=============

**In Development**

.. include:: changelog_legend.inc

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

- |Efficiency| :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` and
  :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` now have much better convergence for
  solvers `"lbfgs"` and `"newton-cg"`. Both solvers can now reach much higher precision
  for the coefficients depending on the specified `tol`. Additionally, lbfgs can
  make better use of `tol`, i.e., stop sooner or reach higher precision.
  :pr:`26721` by :user:`Christian Lorentzen <lorentzenchr>`.

  .. note::

      The lbfgs is the default solver, so this change might effect many models.

      This change also means that with this new version of scikit-learn, the resulting
      coefficients `coef_` and `intercept_` of your models will change for these two
      solvers (when fit on the same data again). The amount of change depends on the
      specified `tol`, for small values you will get more precise results.

- |Fix| fixes a memory leak seen in PyPy for estimators using the Cython loss functions.
  :pr:`27670` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

Changes impacting all modules
-----------------------------

- |Enhancement| All estimators now recognizes the column names from any dataframe
  that adopts the
  `DataFrame Interchange Protocol <https://data-apis.org/dataframe-protocol/latest/purpose_and_scope.html>`__.
  Dataframes that return a correct representation through `np.asarray(df)` is expected
  to work with our estimators and functions.
  :pr:`26464` by `Thomas Fan`_.

- |Enhancement| The HTML representation of estimators now includes a link to the
  documentation and is color-coded to denote whether the estimator is fitted or
  not (unfitted estimators are orange, fitted estimators are blue).
  :pr:`26616` by :user:`Riccardo Cappuzzo <rcap107>`,
  :user:`Ines Ibnukhsein <Ines1999>`, :user:`Gael Varoquaux <GaelVaroquaux>`, and
  :user:`Lilian Boulard <LilianBoulard>`.

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in most estimators and functions where setting a parameter to
  a large integer would cause a `TypeError`.
  :pr:`26648` by :user:`Naoise Holohan <naoise-h>`.

Metadata Routing
----------------

The following models now support metadata routing in one or more or their
methods. Refer to the :ref:`Metadata Routing User Guide <metadata_routing>` for
more details.

- |Feature| :class:`LarsCV` and :class:`LassoLarsCV` now support metadata
  routing in their `fit` method and route metadata to the CV splitter.
  :pr:`27538` by :user:`Omar Salman <OmarManzoor>`.

- |Feature| :class:`multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`,
  :class:`multiclass.OneVsOneClassifier` and
  :class:`multiclass.OutputCodeClassifier` now support metadata routing in
  their ``fit`` and ``partial_fit``, and route metadata to the underlying
  estimator's ``fit`` and ``partial_fit``. :pr:`27308` by :user:`Stefanie
  Senger <StefanieSenger>`.

- |Feature| :class:`pipeline.Pipeline` now supports metadata routing according
  to :ref:`metadata routing user guide <metadata_routing>`. :pr:`26789` by
  `Adrin Jalali`_.

- |Feature| :func:`~model_selection.cross_validate`,
  :func:`~model_selection.cross_val_score`, and
  :func:`~model_selection.cross_val_predict` now support metadata routing. The
  metadata are routed to the estimator's `fit`, the scorer, and the CV
  splitter's `split`. The metadata is accepted via the new `params` parameter.
  `fit_params` is deprecated and will be removed in version 1.6. `groups`
  parameter is also not accepted as a separate argument when metadata routing
  is enabled and should be passed via the `params` parameter. :pr:`26896` by
  `Adrin Jalali`_.

- |Feature| :class:`~model_selection.GridSearchCV`,
  :class:`~model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV`,
  :class:`~model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV`, and
  :class:`~model_selection.HalvingRandomSearchCV` now support metadata routing
  in their ``fit`` and ``score``, and route metadata to the underlying
  estimator's ``fit``, the CV splitter, and the scorer. :pr:`27058` by `Adrin
  Jalali`_.

- |Feature| :class:`~compose.ColumnTransformer` now supports metadata routing
  according to :ref:`metadata routing user guide <metadata_routing>`. :pr:`27005`
  by `Adrin Jalali`_.

- |Feature| :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` now supports
  metadata routing. :meth:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV.fit` now
  accepts ``**params`` which are passed to the underlying splitter and
  scorer. :meth:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV.score` now accepts
  ``**score_params`` which are passed to the underlying scorer.
  :pr:`26525` by :user:`Omar Salman <OmarManzoor>`.

- |Feature| :class:`feature_selection.SelectFromModel` now supports metadata
  routing in `fit` and `partial_fit`.
  :pr:`27490` by :user:`Stefanie Senger <StefanieSenger>`.

- |Feature| :class:`linear_model.OrthogonalMatchingPursuitCV` now supports
  metadata routing. Its `fit` now accepts ``**fit_params``, which are passed to
  the underlying splitter. :pr:`27500` by :user:`Stefanie Senger
  <StefanieSenger>`.

- |Fix| All meta-estimators for which metadata routing is not yet implemented
  now raise a `NotImplementedError` on `get_metadata_routing` and on `fit` if
  metadata routing is enabled and any metadata is passed to them. :pr:`27389`
  by `Adrin Jalali`_.

- |Feature| :class:`ElasticNetCV`, :class:`LassoCV`,
  :class:`MultiTaskElasticNetCV` and :class:`MultiTaskLassoCV`
  now support metadata routing and route metadata to the CV splitter.
  :pr:`27478` by :user:`Omar Salman <OmarManzoor>`.

:mod:`sklearn.base`
...................

- |Enhancement| :meth:`base.ClusterMixin.fit_predict` and
  :meth:`base.OutlierMixin.fit_predict` now accept ``**kwargs`` which are
  passed to the ``fit`` method of the estimator. :pr:`26506` by `Adrin
  Jalali`_.

- |Enhancement| :meth:`base.TransformerMixin.fit_transform` and
  :meth:`base.OutlierMixin.fit_predict` now raise a warning if ``transform`` /
  ``predict`` consume metadata, but no custom ``fit_transform`` / ``fit_predict``
  is defined in the class inheriting from them correspondingly. :pr:`26831` by
  `Adrin Jalali`_.

- |Enhancement| :func:`base.clone` now supports `dict` as input and creates a
  copy. :pr:`26786` by `Adrin Jalali`_.

- |API|:func:`~utils.metadata_routing.process_routing` now has a different
  signature. The first two (the object and the method) are positional only,
  and all metadata are passed as keyword arguments. :pr:`26909` by `Adrin
  Jalali`_.

:mod:`sklearn.calibration`
..........................

- |Enhancement| The internal objective and gradient of the `sigmoid` method
  of :class:`calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV` have been replaced by the
  private loss module. :pr:`27185` by :user:`Omar Salman <OmarManzoor>`.

:mod:`sklearn.cluster`
......................

- |API| : `kdtree` and `balltree` values are now deprecated and are renamed as
  `kd_tree` and `ball_tree` respectively for the `algorithm` parameter of
  :class:`cluster.HDBSCAN` ensuring consistency in naming convention.
  `kdtree` and `balltree` values will be removed in 1.6.
  :pr:`26744` by :user:`Shreesha Kumar Bhat <Shreesha3112>`.

:mod:`sklearn.compose`
......................

- |API| |FIX| :class:`~compose.ColumnTransformer` now replaces `"passthrough"`
  with a corresponding :class:`~preprocessing.FunctionTransformer` in the
  fitted ``transformers_`` attribute. :pr:`27204` by `Adrin Jalali`_.

- |Fix| :func:`cluster.spectral_clustering` and :class:`cluster.SpectralClustering`
  now raise an explicit error message indicating that sparse matrices and arrays
  with `np.int64` indices are not supported.
  :pr:`27240` by :user:`Yao Xiao <Charlie-XIAO>`.

:mod:`sklearn.datasets`
.......................

- |Enhancement| :func:`datasets.make_sparse_spd_matrix` now uses a more memory-
  efficient sparse layout. It also accepts a new keyword `sparse_format` that allows
  specifying the output format of the sparse matrix. By default `sparse_format=None`,
  which returns a dense numpy ndarray as before.
  :pr:`27438` by :user:`Yao Xiao <Charlie-XIAO>`.

:mod:`sklearn.decomposition`
............................

- |Enhancement| An "auto" option was added to the `n_components` parameter of
  :func:`decomposition.non_negative_factorization`, :class:`decomposition.NMF` and
  :class:`decomposition.MiniBatchNMF` to automatically infer the number of components from W or H shapes
  when using a custom initialization. The default value of this parameter will change
  from `None` to `auto` in version 1.6.
  :pr:`26634` by :user:`Alexandre Landeau <AlexL>` and :user:`Alexandre Vigny <avigny>`.

- |Enhancement| :class:`decomposition.PCA` now supports the Array API for the
  `full` and `randomized` solvers (with QR power iterations). See
  :ref:`array_api` for more details.
  :pr:`26315` and :pr:`27098` by :user:`Mateusz Sokół <mtsokol>`,
  :user:`Olivier Grisel <ogrisel>` and :user:`Edoardo Abati <EdAbati>`.

- |Feature| :class:`decomposition.PCA` now supports :class:`scipy.sparse.sparray`
  and :class:`scipy.sparse.spmatrix` inputs when using the `arpack` solver.
  When used on sparse data like :func:`datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` this
  can lead to speed-ups of 100x (single threaded) and 70x lower memory usage.
  Based on :user:`Alexander Tarashansky <atarashansky>`'s implementation in `scanpy <https://github.com/scverse/scanpy>`.
  :pr:`18689` by :user:`Isaac Virshup <ivirshup>` and :user:`Andrey Portnoy <andportnoy>`.

:mod:`sklearn.ensemble`
.......................

- |MajorFeature| :class:`ensemble.RandomForestClassifier` and
  :class:`ensemble.RandomForestRegressor` support missing values when
  the criterion is `gini`, `entropy`, or `log_loss`,
  for classification or `squared_error`, `friedman_mse`, or `poisson`
  for regression. :pr:`26391` by `Thomas Fan`_.

- |Feature| :class:`ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`,
  :class:`ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`, :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier`
  and :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor` now support monotonic constraints,
  useful when features are supposed to have a positive/negative effect on the target.
  Missing values in the train data and multi-output targets are not supported.
  :pr:`13649` by :user:`Samuel Ronsin <samronsin>`,
  initiated by :user:`Patrick O'Reilly <pat-oreilly>`.

- |Efficiency| :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` is faster,
  for binary and in particular for multiclass problems thanks to the private loss
  function module.
  :pr:`26278` by :user:`Christian Lorentzen <lorentzenchr>`.

- |Efficiency| Improves runtime and memory usage for
  :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` and
  :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` when trained on sparse data.
  :pr:`26957` by `Thomas Fan`_.

- |API| In :class:`ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier`, the `algorithm` argument `SAMME.R` was
  deprecated and will be removed in 1.6. :pr:`26830` by :user:`Stefanie Senger
  <StefanieSenger>`.
- |Enhancement| A fitted property, ``estimators_samples_``, was added to all Forest methods,
  including
  :class:`ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`, :class:`ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`,
  :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier` and :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor`,
  which allows to retrieve the training sample indices used for each tree estimator.
  :pr:`26736` by :user:`Adam Li <adam2392>`.

:mod:`sklearn.feature_selection`
................................

- |Fix| :class:`feature_selection.RFE` and :class:`feature_selection.RFECV` do
  not check for nans during input validation.
  :pr:`21807` by `Thomas Fan`_.

:mod:`sklearn.inspection`
.........................

- |Enhancement| :class:`inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay` now accepts a parameter
  `class_of_interest` to select the class of interest when plotting the response
  provided by `response_method="predict_proba"` or
  `response_method="decision_function"`. It allows to plot the decision boundary for
  both binary and multiclass classifiers.
  :pr:`27291` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- |API| :class:`inspection.DecisionBoundaryDisplay` raise an `AttributeError` instead
  of a `ValueError` when an estimator does not implement the requested response method.
  :pr:`27291` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

:mod:`sklearn.linear_model`
...........................

- |Efficiency| :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` and
  :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` now have much better convergence for
  solvers `"lbfgs"` and `"newton-cg"`. Both solvers can now reach much higher precision
  for the coefficients depending on the specified `tol`. Additionally, lbfgs can
  make better use of `tol`, i.e., stop sooner or reach higher precision. This is
  accomplished by better scaling of the objective function, i.e., using average per
  sample losses instead of sum of per sample losses.
  :pr:`26721` by :user:`Christian Lorentzen <lorentzenchr>`.

  .. note::

      This change also means that with this new version of scikit-learn, the resulting
      coefficients `coef_` and `intercept_` of your models will change for these two
      solvers (when fit on the same data again). The amount of change depends on the
      specified `tol`, for small values you will get more precise results.

- |Efficiency| :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` and
  :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` with solver `"newton-cg"` can now be
  considerably faster for some data and parameter settings. This is accomplished by a
  better line search convergence check for negligible loss improvements that takes into
  account gradient information.
  :pr:`26721` by :user:`Christian Lorentzen <lorentzenchr>`.

- |Efficiency| Solver `"newton-cg"` in :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` and
  :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV` uses a little less memory. The effect is
  proportional to the number of coefficients (`n_features * n_classes`).
  :pr:`27417` by :user:`Christian Lorentzen <lorentzenchr>`.

:mod:`sklearn.metrics`
......................

- |Fix| computing pairwise distances with :func:`euclidean_distances` no longer
  raises an exception when `X` is provided as a `float64` array and
  `X_norm_squared` as a `float32` array. :pr:`27624` by
  :user:`Jérôme Dockès <jeromedockes>`.

- |Efficiency| Computing pairwise distances via :class:`metrics.DistanceMetric`
  for CSR × CSR,  Dense × CSR, and CSR × Dense datasets is now 1.5x faster.
  :pr:`26765` by :user:`Meekail Zain <micky774>`

- |Efficiency| Computing distances via :class:`metrics.DistanceMetric`
  for CSR × CSR, Dense × CSR, and CSR × Dense now uses ~50% less memory,
  and outputs distances in the same dtype as the provided data.
  :pr:`27006` by :user:`Meekail Zain <micky774>`

- |Enhancement| Improve the rendering of the plot obtained with the
  :class:`metrics.PrecisionRecallDisplay` and :class:`metrics.RocCurveDisplay`
  classes. the x- and y-axis limits are set to [0, 1] and the aspect ratio between
  both axis is set to be 1 to get a square plot.
  :pr:`26366` by :user:`Mojdeh Rastgoo <mrastgoo>`.

- |Enhancement| Added `neg_root_mean_squared_log_error_scorer` as scorer
  :pr:`26734` by :user:`Alejandro Martin Gil <101AlexMartin>`.

- |Enhancement| :func:`sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score` and
  :func:`sklearn.metrics.zero_one_loss` now support Array API compatible inputs.
  :pr:`27137` by :user:`Edoardo Abati <EdAbati>`.

- |API| Deprecated `needs_threshold` and `needs_proba` from :func:`metrics.make_scorer`.
  These parameters will be removed in version 1.6. Instead, use `response_method` that
  accepts `"predict"`, `"predict_proba"` or `"decision_function"` or a list of such
  values. `needs_proba=True` is equivalent to `response_method="predict_proba"` and
  `needs_threshold=True` is equivalent to
  `response_method=("decision_function", "predict_proba")`.
  :pr:`26840` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- |API| The `squared` parameter of :func:`metrics.mean_squared_error` and
  :func:`metrics.mean_squared_log_error` is deprecated and will be removed in 1.6.
  Use the new functions :func:`metrics.root_mean_squared_error` and
  :func:`metrics.root_mean_squared_log_error` instead.
  :pr:`26734` by :user:`Alejandro Martin Gil <101AlexMartin>`.

- |Fix| :func:`metrics.make_scorer` now raises an error when using a regressor on a
  scorer requesting a non-thresholded decision function (from `decision_function` or
  `predict_proba`). Such scorer are specific to classification.
  :pr:`26840` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- |Enhancement| :func:`metrics.confusion_matrix` now warns when only one label was
  found in `y_true` and `y_pred`. :pr:`27650` by :user:`Lucy Liu <lucyleeow>`.

:mod:`sklearn.model_selection`
..............................

- |Enhancement| :func:`sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` now supports
  Array API compatible inputs. :pr:`26855` by `Tim Head`_.

- |Fix| :class:`model_selection.GridSearchCV`,
  :class:`model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV`, and
  :class:`model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV` now don't change the given
  object in the parameter grid if it's an estimator. :pr:`26786` by `Adrin
  Jalali`_.

:mod:`sklearn.neighbors`
........................

- |Efficiency| :meth:`sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.predict` and
  :meth:`sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.predict_proba` now efficiently support
  pairs of dense and sparse datasets.
  :pr:`27018` by :user:`Julien Jerphanion <jjerphan>`.

- |API| :class:`neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor` now accepts
  :class:`metrics.DistanceMetric` objects directly via the `metric` keyword
  argument allowing for the use of accelerated third-party
  :class:`metrics.DistanceMetric` objects.
  :pr:`26267` by :user:`Meekail Zain <micky774>`.

- |Efficiency| The performance of :meth:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsClassifier.predict`
  and of :meth:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsClassifier.predict_proba` has been improved
  when `radius` is large and `algorithm="brute"` with non-Euclidean metrics.
  :pr:`26828` by :user:`Omar Salman <OmarManzoor>`.

:mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`
............................

- |MajorFeature| :class:`preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`, :class:`preprocessing.MaxAbsScaler`
  and :class:`preprocessing.KernelCenterer` now
  support the `Array API <https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/>`_. Array API
  support is considered experimental and might evolve without being subject to
  our usual rolling deprecation cycle policy. See
  :ref:`array_api` for more details.
  :pr:`26243` by `Tim Head`_, :pr:`27110` by :user:`Edoardo Abati <EdAbati>` and
  :pr:`27556` by :user:`Edoardo Abati <EdAbati>`.

- |Efficiency| :class:`preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder` avoids calculating
  missing indices twice to improve efficiency.
  :pr:`27017` by :user:`Xuefeng Xu <xuefeng-xu>`.

- |Enhancement| Improves warnings in :class:`preprocessing.FunctionTransformer` when
  `func` returns a pandas dataframe and the output is configured to be pandas.
  :pr:`26944` by `Thomas Fan`_.

- |Enhancement| :class:`preprocessing.TargetEncoder` now supports `target_type`
  'multiclass'. :pr:`26674` by :user:`Lucy Liu <lucyleeow>`.

- |Fix| :class:`preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` and :class:`preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder`
  raise an exception when `nan` is a category and is not the last in the user's
  provided categories. :pr:`27309` by :user:`Xuefeng Xu <xuefeng-xu>`.

- |Fix| :class:`preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` and :class:`preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder`
  raise an exception if the user provided categories contain duplicates.
  :pr:`27328` by :user:`Xuefeng Xu <xuefeng-xu>`.

:mod:`sklearn.tree`
...................

- |Feature| :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`, :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor`,
  :class:`tree.ExtraTreeClassifier` and :class:`tree.ExtraTreeRegressor` now support
  monotonic constraints, useful when features are supposed to have a positive/negative
  effect on the target. Missing values in the train data and multi-output targets are
  not supported.
  :pr:`13649` by :user:`Samuel Ronsin <samronsin>`, initiated by
  :user:`Patrick O'Reilly <pat-oreilly>`.

:mod:`sklearn.utils`
....................

- |Enhancement| :func:`sklearn.utils.estimator_html_repr` dynamically adapts
  diagram colors based on the browser's `prefers-color-scheme`, providing
  improved adaptability to dark mode environments.
  :pr:`26862` by :user:`Andrew Goh Yisheng <9y5>`, `Thomas Fan`_, `Adrin
  Jalali`_.

- |Enhancement| :class:`~utils.metadata_routing.MetadataRequest` and
  :class:`~utils.metadata_routing.MetadataRouter` now have a ``consumes`` method
  which can be used to check whether a given set of parameters would be consumed.
  :pr:`26831` by `Adrin Jalali`_.

- |Enhancement| Make :func:`sklearn.utils.check_array` attempt to output
  `int32`-indexed CSR and COO arrays when converting from DIA arrays if the number of
  non-zero entries is small enough. This ensures that estimators implemented in Cython
  and that do not accept `int64`-indexed sparse datastucture, now consistently
  accept the same sparse input formats for SciPy sparse matrices and arrays.
  :pr:`27372` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- |Fix| :func:`sklearn.utils.check_array` should accept both matrix and array from
  the sparse SciPy module. The previous implementation would fail if `copy=True` by
  calling specific NumPy `np.may_share_memory` that does not work with SciPy sparse
  array and does not return the correct result for SciPy sparse matrix.
  :pr:`27336` by :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`.

- |API| :func:`sklearn.extmath.log_logistic` is deprecated and will be removed in 1.6.

- |Fix| :func:`~utils.estimator_checks.check_estimators_pickle` with
  `readonly_memmap=True` now relies on joblib's own capability to allocate
  aligned memory mapped arrays when loading a serialized estimator instead of
  calling a dedicated private function that would crash when OpenBLAS
  misdetects the CPU architecture.
