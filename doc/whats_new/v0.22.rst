Version 0.22.0
==============

**In Development**

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

    TO FILL IN AS WE GO

Details are listed in the changelog below.

(While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we
cannot assure that this list is complete.)

Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

:mod:`sklearn.svm`
..................

- |Enhancement| :class:`svm.SVC` and :class:`svm.NuSVC` now accept a
  ``break_ties`` parameter. This parameter results in :term:`predict` breaking
  the ties according to the confidence values of :term:`decision_function`, if
  ``decision_function_shape='ovr'``, and the number of target classes > 2.
  :pr:`12557` by `Adrin Jalali`_.


:mod:`sklearn.neural_network`
.............................

- |Feature| Add `max_fun` parameter in
  :class:`neural_network.BaseMultilayerPerceptron`,
  :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor`, and
  :class:`neural_network.MLPClassifier` to give control over
  maximum number of function evaluation to not meet ``tol`` improvement.
  :issue:`9274` by :user:`Daniel Perry <daniel-perry>`.


Miscellaneous
.............

- |API| Replace manual checks with ``check_is_fitted``. Errors thrown when
  using a non-fitted estimators are now more uniform.
  :pr:`13013` by :user:`Agamemnon Krasoulis <agamemnonc>`.

Changes to estimator checks
---------------------------

These changes mostly affect library developers.

- Estimators are now expected to raise a ``NotFittedError`` if ``predict`` or
  ``transform`` is called before ``fit``; previously an ``AttributeError`` or
  ``ValueError`` was acceptable.
  :pr:`13013` by by :user:`Agamemnon Krasoulis <agamemnonc>`.
