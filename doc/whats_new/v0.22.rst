Version 0.22.0
==============

**In Development**

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

    TO FILL IN AS WE GO

Details are listed in the changelog below.

(While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we
cannot assure that this list is complete.)

Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

:mod:`sklearn.metrics`
......................

- |Enhancement| Add `fpr_range` and `tpr_range` to
  :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score` to calculate the standardize partial AUC
  over the range of true positive rates and false positive rate.
  :issue:`11668` by `Joel Nothman`_ and :user:`Zijie (ZJ) Poh <zjpoh>`

- |API| The parameter `max_fpr` in :func:`metrics.roc_auc_score` deprecated
  in version 0.21 and will be removed in version 0.23.
  This parameter is removed in favor of `fpr_range`.

These changes mostly affect library developers.
