Contributing to scikit-learn
============================

The latest contributing guide is available in the repository at
`doc/developers/contributing.rst`, or online at:

https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html

There are many ways to contribute to scikit-learn. Improving the
documentation is no less important than improving the code of the library
itself. If you find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do
not hesitate to create a GitHub issue or preferably submit a GitHub pull request.

There are many other ways to help. In particular [improving, triaging, and
investigating issues](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues),
and [reviewing other developers' pull
requests](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#code-review-guidelines)
are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project
maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs
up" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps
us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles,
link to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say "I use it".
