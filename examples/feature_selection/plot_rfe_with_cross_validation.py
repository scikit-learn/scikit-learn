# We build a classification task using 3 informative features. The introduction
# of 2 additional redundant (i.e. correlated) features has the effect that the
# selected features vary depending on the cross-validation fold. The remaining
# features are non-informative as they are drawn at random.

# From the plot above one can further notice a plateau of equivalent scores
# (similar mean value and overlapping errorbars) for 3 to 5 selected features.
# This is the result of introducing correlated features. Indeed, the optimal
# model selected by the RFE can lie within this range, depending on the
# cross-validation technique. The test negative log loss decreases above 5 selected
# features, this is, keeping non-informative features leads to over-fitting and
# is therefore detrimental for the statistical performance of the models.

# Using `permutation_importance` to select features
# -------------------------------------------------
# The `importance_getter` parameter in RFE and RFECV uses by default the `coef_` (e.g.
# in linear models) or the `feature_importances_` attributes of an estimator to derive
# feature importance. These importance measures are used to choose which features to
# eliminate first.
#
# We show here how to use a callable to compute the `permutation_importance` instead.
# This callable must accept a fitted model and the external validation samples that we
# pass in `fit()`.
