=========================================================
Imputing missing values with variants of IterativeImputer
=========================================================

.. currentmodule:: sklearn

The :class:`~impute.IterativeImputer` class is very flexible - it can be
used with a variety of estimators to do round-robin regression, treating every
variable as an output in turn.

In this example we compare some estimators for the purpose of missing feature
imputation with :class:`~impute.IterativeImputer`:

* :class:`~linear_model.BayesianRidge`: regularized linear regression
* :class:`~ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`: Forests of randomized trees regression
* :func:`~pipeline.make_pipeline` (:class:`~kernel_approximation.Nystroem`,
  :class:`~linear_model.Ridge`): a pipeline with the expansion of a degree 2
  polynomial kernel and regularized linear regression
* :class:`~neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor`: comparable to other KNN
  imputation approaches

Of particular interest is the ability of
:class:`~impute.IterativeImputer` to mimic the behavior of missForest, a
popular imputation package for R.

Note that :class:`~neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor` is different from KNN
imputation, which learns from samples with missing values by using a distance
metric that accounts for missing values, rather than imputing them.

The goal is to compare different estimators to see which one is best for the
:class:`~impute.IterativeImputer` when using a
:class:`~linear_model.BayesianRidge` estimator on the California housing
dataset with a single value randomly removed from each row.

For this particular pattern of missing values we see that
:class:`~linear_model.BayesianRidge` and
:class:`~ensemble.RandomForestRegressor` give the best results.

It should be noted that some estimators such as
:class:`~ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` can natively deal with
missing features and are often recommended over building pipelines with
complex and costly missing values imputation strategies.
