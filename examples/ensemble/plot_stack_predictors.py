=================================
Combine predictors using stacking
=================================

.. currentmodule:: sklearn

Stacking is an :ref:`ensemble method <ensemble>`. In this strategy, the
out-of-fold predictions from several base estimators are used to train a
meta-model that combines their outputs at inference time. Unlike
:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.VotingRegressor`, which averages predictions with
fixed (optionally user-specified) weights,
:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.StackingRegressor` learns the combination through its
`final_estimator`.

In this example, we illustrate the use case in which different regressors are
stacked together and a final regularized linear regressor is used to output the
prediction. We compare the performance of each individual regressor with the
stacking strategy. Here, stacking slightly improves the overall performance.

# Stack of predictors on a single data set
# ########################################
#
# It is sometimes not evident which model is more suited for a given task, as
# different model families can achieve similar performance while exhibiting
# different strengths and weaknesses. Stacking combines their outputs to exploit
# these complementary behaviors and can correct systematic errors that no
# single model can fix on its own. With appropriate regularization in the
# `final_estimator`, the :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.StackingRegressor` often matches the strongest base
# model, and can outperform it when base learners' errors are only partially
# correlated, allowing the combination to reduce individual bias/variance.
#
# Here, we combine 3 learners (linear and non-linear) and use the default
# :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV` regressor to combine their outputs
# together.
#
# .. note::
#    Although some base learners include preprocessing (such as the
#    :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`), the `final_estimator` does
#    not need additional preprocessing when using the default
#    `passthrough=False`, as it receives only the base learners' predictions. If
#    `passthrough=True`, `final_estimator` should be a pipeline with proper
#    preprocessing.

# Even if the scores overlap considerably after cross-validation, the predictions

# ridge also contributing meaningfully. The plain linear model does not add
# useful signal once those two are in place; with
# :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV` as the `final_estimator`, it is not
# dropped but gets a tiny negative weight that acts as a small correction to
# counter its residual bias.
#
# If we switch to :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV` as the
# `final_estimator`, that small, unhelpful contribution is set exactly to zero,
# yielding a simpler blend of the spline ridge and HGBT models.

# How to mimic SuperLearner with scikit-learn
# ###########################################
#
# The `SuperLearner` [Polley2010]_ is a stacking strategy implemented as `an R
# package <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SuperLearner/index.html>`_, but
# not available off-the-shelf in Python. It is closely related to the
# :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.StackingRegressor`, as both train the meta-model on
# out-of-fold predictions from the base estimators.
#
# The key difference is that `SuperLearner` estimates a convex set of
# meta-weights (non-negative and summing to 1) and omits an intercept; by
# contrast, :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.StackingRegressor` uses an unconstrained
# meta-learner with an intercept by default (and can optionally include raw
# features via passthrough).
#
# Without an intercept, the meta-weights are directly interpretable as
# fractional contributions to the final prediction.

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

linear_reg = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False, positive=True)
stacking_regressor = StackingRegressor(
    estimators=estimators, final_estimator=linear_reg
)
stacking_regressor.fit(X, y)
stacking_regressor.final_estimator_.coef_

# %%
# The sum of meta-weights in the stacked regressor is close to 1.0, but not
# exactly one:

stacking_regressor.final_estimator_.coef_.sum()

# %%
# Beyond interpretability, the normalization to 1.0 constraint in the `SuperLearner`
# presents the following advantages:
#
# - Consensus-preserving: if all base models output the same value at a point,
#   the ensemble returns that same value (no artificial amplification or
#   attenuation).
# - Translation-equivariant: adding a constant to every base prediction shifts
#   the ensemble by the same constant.
# - Removes one degree of freedom: avoiding redundancy with a constant term and
#   modestly stabilizing weights under collinearity.
#
# Conclusions
# ###########
#
# The stacked regressor combines the strengths of the different regressors.
# However, notice that training the stacked regressor is much more
# computationally expensive than selecting the best performing model.
