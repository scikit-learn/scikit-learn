Combine predictors using stacking
=================================

.. currentmodule:: sklearn

Stacking refers to a method to blend estimators. In this strategy, some
estimators are individually fitted on some training data while a final
estimator is trained using the stacked predictions of these base estimators.

In this example, we illustrate the use case in which different regressors are
stacked together and a final linear penalized regressor is used to output the
prediction. We compare the performance of each individual regressor with the
stacking strategy. Stacking slightly improves the overall performance.

# We will use the `Ames Housing`_ dataset which was first compiled by Dean De Cock
# and became better known after it was used in Kaggle challenge. It is a set
# of 1460 residential homes in Ames, Iowa, each described by 80 features. We
# will use it to predict the final logarithmic price of the houses. In this
# example we will use only 20 most interesting features chosen using
# GradientBoostingRegressor() and limit number of entries (here we won't go
# into the details on how to select the most interesting features).
#
# The Ames housing dataset is not shipped with scikit-learn and therefore we
# will fetch it from `OpenML`_.

# Stack of predictors on a single data set
# ########################################
#
# It is sometimes tedious to find the model which will best perform on a given
# dataset. Stacking provide an alternative by combining the outputs of several
# learners, without the need to choose a model specifically. The performance of
# stacking is usually close to the best model and sometimes it can outperform
# the prediction performance of each individual model.
#
# Here, we combine 3 learners (linear and non-linear) and use a ridge regressor
# to combine their outputs together.
#
# .. note::
#    Although we will make new pipelines with the processors which we wrote in
#    the previous section for the 3 learners, the final estimator
#    :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV()` does not need preprocessing of
#    the data as it will be fed with the already preprocessed output from the 3
#    learners.
