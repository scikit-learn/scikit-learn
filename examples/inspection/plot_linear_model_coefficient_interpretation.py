Common pitfalls in the interpretation of coefficients of linear models
======================================================================

In linear models, the target value is modeled as a linear combination of the
features (see the :ref:`linear_model` User Guide section for a description of a
set of linear models available in scikit-learn). Coefficients in multiple linear
models represent the relationship between the given feature, :math:`X_i` and the
target, :math:`y`, assuming that all the other features remain constant
(`conditional dependence
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_dependence>`_). This is different
from plotting :math:`X_i` versus :math:`y` and fitting a linear relationship: in
that case all possible values of the other features are taken into account in
the estimation (marginal dependence).

This example will provide some hints in interpreting coefficient in linear
models, pointing at problems that arise when either the linear model is not
appropriate to describe the dataset, or when features are correlated.

.. note::

    Keep in mind that the features :math:`X` and the outcome :math:`y` are in
    general the result of a data generating process that is unknown to us.
    Machine learning models are trained to approximate the unobserved
    mathematical function that links :math:`X` to :math:`y` from sample data. As
    a result, any interpretation made about a model may not necessarily
    generalize to the true data generating process. This is especially true when
    the model is of bad quality or when the sample data is not representative of
    the population.

We will use data from the `"Current Population Survey"
<https://www.openml.org/d/534>`_ from 1985 to predict wage as a function of
various features such as experience, age, or education.

# In particular categorical variables cannot be included in linear model if not

# treated as ordered values, we need to one-hot-encode them.
# Our pre-processor will
#
# - one-hot encode (i.e., generate a column by category) the categorical
#   columns, only for non-binary categorical variables;
# - as a first approach (we will see after how the normalisation of numerical
#   values will affect our discussion), keep numerical values as they are.

# dollars/hour. On the other hand, categorical variables (as UNION or SEX) are
# adimensional numbers taking either the value 0 or 1. Their coefficients
# are expressed in dollars/hour. Then, we cannot compare the magnitude of
# different coefficients since the features have different natural scales, and

# appears to be the
# variable UNION, even if our intuition might tell us that variables
# like EXPERIENCE should have more impact.
#
# Looking at the coefficient plot to gauge feature importance can be
# misleading as some of them vary on a small scale, while others, like AGE,
# varies a lot more, several decades.

# This is visible if we compare the standard deviations of different

# numerical variables to their standard deviation,
# as :math:`y = \sum{coef_i \times X_i} =
# \sum{(coef_i \times std_i) \times (X_i / std_i)}`.

# %%
# Now that the coefficients have been scaled, we can safely compare them.
#
# .. warning::
#
#   Why does the plot above suggest that an increase in age leads to a
#   decrease in wage? Why the :ref:`initial pairplot
#   <marginal_dependencies>` is telling the opposite?
#
# The plot above tells us about dependencies between a specific feature and
# the target when all other features remain constant, i.e., **conditional
# dependencies**. An increase of the AGE will induce a decrease
# of the WAGE when all other features remain constant. On the contrary, an
# increase of the EXPERIENCE will induce an increase of the WAGE when all
# other features remain constant.
# Also, AGE, EXPERIENCE and EDUCATION are the three variables that most
# influence the model.
#
# Interpreting coefficients: being cautious about causality
# ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# Linear models are a great tool for measuring statistical association, but we
# should be cautious when making statements about causality, after all
# correlation doesn't always imply causation. This is particularly difficult in
# the social sciences because the variables we observe only function as proxies
# for the underlying causal process.
#
# In our particular case we can think of the EDUCATION of an individual as a
# proxy for their professional aptitude, the real variable we're interested in
# but can't observe. We'd certainly like to think that staying in school for
# longer would increase technical competency, but it's also quite possible that
# causality goes the other way too. That is, those who are technically
# competent tend to stay in school for longer.
#
# An employer is unlikely to care which case it is (or if it's a mix of both),
# as long as they remain convinced that a person with more EDUCATION is better
# suited for the job, they will be happy to pay out a higher WAGE.
#
# This confounding of effects becomes problematic when thinking about some
# form of intervention e.g. government subsidies of university degrees or
# promotional material encouraging individuals to take up higher education.
# The usefulness of these measures could end up being overstated, especially if
# the degree of confounding is strong. Our model predicts a :math:`0.054699`
# increase in hourly wage for each year of education. The actual causal effect
# might be lower because of this confounding.
#
# Checking the variability of the coefficients
# --------------------------------------------
#
# We can check the coefficient variability through cross-validation:
# it is a form of data perturbation (related to
# `resampling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)>`_).
#
# If coefficients vary significantly when changing the input dataset
# their robustness is not guaranteed, and they should probably be interpreted
# with caution.

# true effect of a change in the standardized education variable on wages.
#
# Unfortunately there are likely unobserved confounding variables that either
# inflate or deflate that coefficient. A confounding variable is a variable that
# causes both EDUCATION and WAGE. One example of such variable is ability.
# Presumably, more able people are more likely to pursue education while at the
# same time being more likely to earn a higher hourly wage at any level of
# education. In this case, ability induces a positive `Omitted Variable Bias
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omitted-variable_bias>`_ (OVB) on the EDUCATION
# coefficient, thereby exaggerating the effect of education on wages.
#
# See the :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_inspection_plot_causal_interpretation.py`
# for a simulated case of ability OVB.

# Lessons learned
# ---------------
#
# * Coefficients must be scaled to the same unit of measure to retrieve
#   feature importance. Scaling them with the standard-deviation of the
#   feature is a useful proxy.
# * Interpreting causality is difficult when there are confounding effects. If
#   the relationship between two variables is also affected by something
#   unobserved, we should be careful when making conclusions about causality.
# * Coefficients in multivariate linear models represent the dependency
#   between a given feature and the target, **conditional** on the other
#   features.
# * Correlated features induce instabilities in the coefficients of linear
#   models and their effects cannot be well teased apart.
# * Different linear models respond differently to feature correlation and
#   coefficients could significantly vary from one another.
# * Inspecting coefficients across the folds of a cross-validation loop
#   gives an idea of their stability.
# * Coefficients are unlikely to have any causal meaning. They tend
#   to be biased by unobserved confounders.
# * Inspection tools may not necessarily provide insights on the true
#   data generating process.
