Understanding the decision tree structure
=========================================

The decision tree structure can be analysed to gain further insight on the
relation between the features and the target to predict. In this example, we
show how to retrieve:

- the binary tree structure;
- the depth of each node and whether or not it's a leaf;
- the nodes that were reached by a sample using the ``decision_path`` method;
- the leaf that was reached by a sample using the apply method;
- the rules that were used to predict a sample;
- the decision path shared by a group of samples.

# The decision estimator has an attribute called tree_  which stores the entire
# tree structure and allows access to low level attributes. The binary tree
# tree_ is represented as a number of parallel arrays. The i-th element of each
# array holds information about the node `i`. Node 0 is the tree's root. NOTE:
# Some of the arrays only apply to either leaves or split nodes, resp. In this
# case the values of nodes of the other type are arbitrary!
#
# Among those arrays, we have:
#   - left_child, id of the left child of the node
#   - right_child, id of the right child of the node
#   - feature, feature used for splitting the node
#   - threshold, threshold value at the node
#
