=========================================
Nested versus non-nested cross-validation
=========================================

This example compares non-nested and nested cross-validation strategies on a
classifier of the iris data set. Nested cross-validation (CV) is often used to
train a model in which hyperparameters also need to be optimized. Nested CV
estimates the generalization error of the underlying model and its
(hyper)parameter search. Choosing the parameters that maximize non-nested CV
biases the model to the dataset, yielding an overly-optimistic score.

Model selection without nested CV uses the same data to tune model parameters
and evaluate model performance. Information may thus "leak" into the model
and overfit the data. The magnitude of this effect is primarily dependent on
the size of the dataset and the stability of the model. See Cawley and Talbot
[1]_ for an analysis of these issues.

To avoid this problem, nested CV effectively uses a series of
train/validation/test set splits. In the inner loop (here executed by
:class:`GridSearchCV <sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV>`), the score is
approximately maximized by fitting a model to each training set, and then
directly maximized in selecting (hyper)parameters over the validation set. In
the outer loop (here in :func:`cross_val_score
<sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score>`), generalization error is estimated
by averaging test set scores over several dataset splits.

The example below uses a support vector classifier with a non-linear kernel to
build a model with optimized hyperparameters by grid search. We compare the
performance of non-nested and nested CV strategies by taking the difference
between their scores.
