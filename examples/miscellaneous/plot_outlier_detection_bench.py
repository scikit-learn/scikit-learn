Evaluation of outlier detection estimators
==========================================

This example compares two outlier detection algorithms, namely
:ref:`local_outlier_factor` (LOF) and :ref:`isolation_forest` (IForest), on
real-world datasets available in :class:`sklearn.datasets`. The goal is to show
that different algorithms perform well on different datasets and contrast their
training speed and sensitivity to hyperparameters.

The algorithms are trained (without labels) on the whole dataset assumed to
contain outliers.

1. The ROC curves are computed using knowledge of the ground-truth labels
and displayed using :class:`~sklearn.metrics.RocCurveDisplay`.

2. The performance is assessed in terms of the ROC-AUC.

# Dataset preprocessing and model training
# ========================================
#
# Different outlier detection models require different preprocessing. In the
# presence of categorical variables,
# :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.OrdinalEncoder` is often a good strategy for
# tree-based models such as :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest`, whereas
# neighbors-based models such as :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor`
# would be impacted by the ordering induced by ordinal encoding. To avoid
# inducing an ordering, on should rather use
# :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`.
#
# Neighbors-based models may also require scaling of the numerical features (see
# for instance :ref:`neighbors_scaling`). In the presence of outliers, a good
# option is to use a :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler`.

# On the rest of the example we process one dataset per section. After loading

# inliers and 1 representing outliers. Due to computational constraints of the
# scikit-learn documentation, the sample size of some datasets is reduced using
# a stratified :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`.
#
# Furthermore, we set `n_neighbors` to match the expected number of anomalies

# heuristic as long as the proportion of outliers is not very low, the reason
# being that `n_neighbors` should be at least greater than the number of samples

# We observe that once the number of neighbors is tuned, LOF and IForest perform
# similarly in terms of ROC AUC for the forestcover and cardiotocography
# datasets. The score for IForest is slightly better for the SA dataset and LOF
# performs considerably better on the Ames housing dataset than IForest.
#
# Recall however that Isolation Forest tends to train much faster than LOF on
# datasets with a large number of samples. LOF needs to compute pairwise
# distances to find nearest neighbors, which has a quadratic complexity with respect
# to the number of observations. This can make this method prohibitive on large
# datasets.
#
# Ablation study
# ==============
#
# In this section we explore the impact of the hyperparameter `n_neighbors` and
# the choice of scaling the numerical variables on the LOF model. Here we use
# the :ref:`covtype_dataset` dataset as the binary encoded categories introduce
# a natural scale of euclidean distances between 0 and 1. We then want a scaling
# method to avoid granting a privilege to non-binary features and that is robust
# enough to outliers so that the task of finding them does not become too
# difficult.

# On the one hand, :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler` scales each
# feature independently by using the interquartile range (IQR) by default, which
# is the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data. It centers the
# data by subtracting the median and then scale it by dividing by the IQR. The
# IQR is robust to outliers: the median and interquartile range are less
# affected by extreme values than the range, the mean and the standard
# deviation. Furthermore, :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler` does not
# squash marginal outlier values, contrary to
# :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`.
#
# On the other hand, :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler` scales each
# feature individually such that its range maps into the range between zero and
# one. If there are outliers in the data, they can skew it towards either the
# minimum or maximum values, leading to a completely different distribution of
# data with large marginal outliers: all non-outlier values can be collapsed
# almost together as a result.
