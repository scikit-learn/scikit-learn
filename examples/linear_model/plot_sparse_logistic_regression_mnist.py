=====================================================
MNIST classification using multinomial logistic + L1
=====================================================

Here we fit a multinomial logistic regression with L1 penalty on a subset of
the MNIST digits classification task. We use the SAGA algorithm for this
purpose: this a solver that is fast when the number of samples is significantly
larger than the number of features and is able to finely optimize non-smooth
objective functions which is the case with the l1-penalty. Test accuracy
reaches > 0.8, while weight vectors remains *sparse* and therefore more easily
*interpretable*.

Note that this accuracy of this l1-penalized linear model is significantly
below what can be reached by an l2-penalized linear model or a non-linear
multi-layer perceptron model on this dataset.
