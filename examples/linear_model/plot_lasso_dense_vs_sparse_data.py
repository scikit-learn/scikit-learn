Lasso on dense and sparse data
==============================

We show that linear_model.Lasso provides the same results for dense and sparse
data and that in the case of sparse data the speed is improved.

# Comparing the two Lasso implementations on Dense data
# -----------------------------------------------------
#
# We create a linear regression problem that is suitable for the Lasso,
# that is to say, with more features than samples. We then store the data
# matrix in both dense (the usual) and sparse format, and train a Lasso on
# each. We compute the runtime of both and check that they learned the
# same model by computing the Euclidean norm of the difference between the
# coefficients they learned. Because the data is dense, we expect better
# runtime with a dense data format.
