Tweedie regression on insurance claims
======================================

This example illustrates the use of Poisson, Gamma and Tweedie regression on
the `French Motor Third-Party Liability Claims dataset
<https://www.openml.org/d/41214>`_, and is inspired by an R tutorial [1]_.

In this dataset, each sample corresponds to an insurance policy, i.e. a
contract within an insurance company and an individual (policyholder).
Available features include driver age, vehicle age, vehicle power, etc.

A few definitions: a *claim* is the request made by a policyholder to the
insurer to compensate for a loss covered by the insurance. The *claim amount*
is the amount of money that the insurer must pay. The *exposure* is the
duration of the insurance coverage of a given policy, in years.

Here our goal is to predict the expected
value, i.e. the mean, of the total claim amount per exposure unit also
referred to as the pure premium.

There are several possibilities to do that, two of which are:

1. Model the number of claims with a Poisson distribution, and the average
   claim amount per claim, also known as severity, as a Gamma distribution
   and multiply the predictions of both in order to get the total claim
   amount.
2. Model the total claim amount per exposure directly, typically with a Tweedie
   distribution of Tweedie power :math:`p \\in (1, 2)`.

In this example we will illustrate both approaches. We start by defining a few
helper functions for loading the data and visualizing results.

# Pure Premium Modeling via a Product Model vs single TweedieRegressor
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# As mentioned in the introduction, the total claim amount per unit of
# exposure can be modeled as the product of the prediction of the
# frequency model by the prediction of the severity model.
#
# Alternatively, one can directly model the total loss with a unique
# Compound Poisson Gamma generalized linear model (with a log link function).
# This model is a special case of the Tweedie GLM with a "power" parameter
# :math:`p \in (1, 2)`. Here, we fix apriori the `power` parameter of the
# Tweedie model to some arbitrary value (1.9) in the valid range. Ideally one
# would select this value via grid-search by minimizing the negative
# log-likelihood of the Tweedie model, but unfortunately the current
# implementation does not allow for this (yet).
#
# We will compare the performance of both approaches.
# To quantify the performance of both models, one can compute
# the mean deviance of the train and test data assuming a Compound
# Poisson-Gamma distribution of the total claim amount. This is equivalent to
# a Tweedie distribution with a `power` parameter between 1 and 2.
#
# The :func:`sklearn.metrics.mean_tweedie_deviance` depends on a `power`
# parameter. As we do not know the true value of the `power` parameter, we here
# compute the mean deviances for a grid of possible values, and compare the
# models side by side, i.e. we compare them at identical values of `power`.
# Ideally, we hope that one model will be consistently better than the other,
# regardless of `power`.

#
# Finally, we can compare the two models using a plot of cumulative claims: for
# each model, the policyholders are ranked from safest to riskiest based on the
# model predictions and the cumulative proportion of claim amounts is plotted
# against the cumulative proportion of exposure. This plot is often called
# the ordered Lorenz curve of the model.
#
# The Gini coefficient (based on the area between the curve and the diagonal)
# can be used as a model selection metric to quantify the ability of the model
# to rank policyholders. Note that this metric does not reflect the ability of
# the models to make accurate predictions in terms of absolute value of total
# claim amounts but only in terms of relative amounts as a ranking metric. The
# Gini coefficient is upper bounded by 1.0 but even an oracle model that ranks
# the policyholders by the observed claim amounts cannot reach a score of 1.0.
#
# We observe that both models are able to rank policyholders by riskiness
# significantly better than chance although they are also both far from the
# oracle model due to the natural difficulty of the prediction problem from a
# few features: most accidents are not predictable and can be caused by
# environmental circumstances that are not described at all by the input
# features of the models.
#
# Note that the Gini index only characterizes the ranking performance of the
# model but not its calibration: any monotonic transformation of the predictions
# leaves the Gini index of the model unchanged.
#
# Finally one should highlight that the Compound Poisson Gamma model that is
# directly fit on the pure premium is operationally simpler to develop and
# maintain as it consists of a single scikit-learn estimator instead of a pair
# of models, each with its own set of hyperparameters.
