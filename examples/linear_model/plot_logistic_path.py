==============================================
Regularization path of L1- Logistic Regression
==============================================


Train l1-penalized logistic regression models on a binary classification
problem derived from the Iris dataset.

The models are ordered from strongest regularized to least regularized. The 4
coefficients of the models are collected and plotted as a "regularization
path": on the left-hand side of the figure (strong regularizers), all the
coefficients are exactly 0. When regularization gets progressively looser,
coefficients can get non-zero values one after the other.

Here we choose the liblinear solver because it can efficiently optimize for the
Logistic Regression loss with a non-smooth, sparsity inducing l1 penalty.

Also note that we set a low value for the tolerance to make sure that the model
has converged before collecting the coefficients.

We also use warm_start=True which means that the coefficients of the models are
reused to initialize the next model fit to speed-up the computation of the
full-path.
