# to store the image.

# Note that depending of the SciPy version, we have to adapt the import since the
# function returning the image is not located in the same module. Also, SciPy >= 1.10
# requires the package `pooch` to be installed.

# Thus the image is a 2D array of 768 pixels in height and 1024 pixels in width. Each

# bits per pixel. The total memory usage of the image is 786 kilobytes (1 byte equals
# 8 bits).
#
# Using 8-bit unsigned integer means that the image is encoded using 256 different
# shades of gray, at most. We can check the distribution of these values.

# Compression via vector quantization
# -----------------------------------
#
# The idea behind compression via vector quantization is to reduce the number of
# gray levels to represent an image. For instance, we can use 8 values instead
# of 256 values. Therefore, it means that we could efficiently use 3 bits instead
# of 8 bits to encode a single pixel and therefore reduce the memory usage by a
# factor of approximately 2.5. We will later discuss about this memory usage.
#
# Encoding strategy
# """""""""""""""""
#
# The compression can be done using a
# :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer`. We need to choose a strategy
# to define the 8 gray values to sub-sample. The simplest strategy is to define
# them equally spaced, which correspond to setting `strategy="uniform"`. From
# the previous histogram, we know that this strategy is certainly not optimal.

# It is quite surprising to see that our compressed image is taking x8 more
# memory than the original image. This is indeed the opposite of what we
# expected. The reason is mainly due to the type of data used to encode the
# image.

# %%
# Indeed, the output of the :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer` is
# an array of 64-bit float. It means that it takes x8 more memory. However, we
# use this 64-bit float representation to encode 8 values. Indeed, we will save
# memory only if we cast the compressed image into an array of 3-bits integers. We
# could use the method `numpy.ndarray.astype`. However, a 3-bits integer
# representation does not exist and to encode the 8 values, we would need to use
# the 8-bit unsigned integer representation as well.
#
# In practice, observing a memory gain would require the original image to be in
# a 64-bit float representation.
