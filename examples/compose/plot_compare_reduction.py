=================================================================
Selecting dimensionality reduction with Pipeline and GridSearchCV
=================================================================

This example constructs a pipeline that does dimensionality
reduction followed by prediction with a support vector
classifier. It demonstrates the use of ``GridSearchCV`` and
``Pipeline`` to optimize over different classes of estimators in a
single CV run -- unsupervised ``PCA`` and ``NMF`` dimensionality
reductions are compared to univariate feature selection during
the grid search.

Additionally, ``Pipeline`` can be instantiated with the ``memory``
argument to memoize the transformers within the pipeline, avoiding to fit
again the same transformers over and over.

Note that the use of ``memory`` to enable caching becomes interesting when the
fitting of a transformer is costly.

# Caching transformers within a ``Pipeline``
# ##########################################
#
# It is sometimes worthwhile storing the state of a specific transformer
# since it could be used again. Using a pipeline in ``GridSearchCV`` triggers
# such situations. Therefore, we use the argument ``memory`` to enable caching.
#
# .. warning::
#     Note that this example is, however, only an illustration since for this
#     specific case fitting PCA is not necessarily slower than loading the
#     cache. Hence, use the ``memory`` constructor parameter when the fitting
#     of a transformer is costly.

from shutil import rmtree

from joblib import Memory

# Create a temporary folder to store the transformers of the pipeline
location = "cachedir"
memory = Memory(location=location, verbose=10)
cached_pipe = Pipeline(
    [("reduce_dim", PCA()), ("classify", LinearSVC(dual=False, max_iter=10000))],
    memory=memory,
)

# This time, a cached pipeline will be used within the grid search


# Delete the temporary cache before exiting
memory.clear(warn=False)
rmtree(location)

# %%
# The ``PCA`` fitting is only computed at the evaluation of the first
# configuration of the ``C`` parameter of the ``LinearSVC`` classifier. The
# other configurations of ``C`` will trigger the loading of the cached ``PCA``
# estimator data, leading to save processing time. Therefore, the use of
# caching the pipeline using ``memory`` is highly beneficial when fitting
# a transformer is costly.
