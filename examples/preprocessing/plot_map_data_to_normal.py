=================================
Map data to a normal distribution
=================================

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.preprocessing

This example demonstrates the use of the Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transforms
through :class:`~PowerTransformer` to map data from various
distributions to a normal distribution.

The power transform is useful as a transformation in modeling problems where
homoscedasticity and normality are desired. Below are examples of Box-Cox and
Yeo-Johnwon applied to six different probability distributions: Lognormal,
Chi-squared, Weibull, Gaussian, Uniform, and Bimodal.

Note that the transformations successfully map the data to a normal
distribution when applied to certain datasets, but are ineffective with others.
This highlights the importance of visualizing the data before and after
transformation.

Also note that even though Box-Cox seems to perform better than Yeo-Johnson for
lognormal and chi-squared distributions, keep in mind that Box-Cox does not
support inputs with negative values.

For comparison, we also add the output from
:class:`~QuantileTransformer`. It can force any arbitrary
distribution into a gaussian, provided that there are enough training samples
(thousands). Because it is a non-parametric method, it is harder to interpret
than the parametric ones (Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson).

On "small" datasets (less than a few hundred points), the quantile transformer
is prone to overfitting. The use of the power transform is then recommended.
