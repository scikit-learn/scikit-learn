===============================================================================
Decision boundary of semi-supervised classifiers versus SVM on the Iris dataset
===============================================================================

This example compares decision boundaries learned by two semi-supervised
methods, namely :class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelSpreading` and
:class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.SelfTrainingClassifier`, while varying the
proportion of labeled training data from small fractions up to the full dataset.

Both methods rely on RBF kernels: :class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelSpreading` uses
it by default, and :class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.SelfTrainingClassifier` is paired
here with :class:`~sklearn.svm.SVC` as base estimator (also RBF-based by default) to
allow a fair comparison. With 100% labeled data,
:class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.SelfTrainingClassifier` reduces to a fully supervised
:class:`~sklearn.svm.SVC`, since there are no unlabeled points left to pseudo-label.

In a second section, we explain how `predict_proba` is computed in
:class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelSpreading` and
:class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.SelfTrainingClassifier`.

See
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_semi_supervised_plot_semi_supervised_newsgroups.py`
for a comparison of `LabelSpreading` and `SelfTrainingClassifier` in terms of
performance.

# We observe that the decision boundaries are already quite similar to those
# using the full labeled data available for training, even when using a very
# small subset of the labels.
#
# Interpretation of `predict_proba`
# =================================
#
# `predict_proba` in `LabelSpreading`
# -----------------------------------
#
# :class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelSpreading` constructs a similarity graph
# from the data, by default using an RBF kernel. This means each sample is
# connected to every other with a weight that decays with their squared
# Euclidean distance, scaled by a parameter `gamma`.
#
# Once we have that weighted graph, labels are propagated along the graph
# edges. Each sample gradually takes on a soft label distribution that reflects
# a weighted average of the labels of its neighbors until the process converges.
# These per-sample distributions are stored in `label_distributions_`.
#
# `predict_proba` computes the class probabilities for a new point by taking a
# weighted average of the rows in `label_distributions_`, where the weights come
# from the RBF kernel similarities between the new point and the training
# samples. The averaged values are then renormalized so that they sum to one.
#
# Just keep in mind that these "probabilities" are graph-based scores, not
# calibrated posteriors. Don't over-interpret their absolute values.

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import rbf_kernel

ls = ls100[0]  # fitted LabelSpreading instance
x_query = np.array([[3.5, 1.5]])  # point in the soft blue region

# Step 1: similarities between query and all training samples
W = rbf_kernel(x_query, X, gamma=ls.gamma)  # `gamma=20` by default

# Step 2: weighted average of label distributions
probs = np.dot(W, ls.label_distributions_)

# Step 3: normalize to sum to 1
probs /= probs.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)

print("Manual:", probs)
print("API   :", ls.predict_proba(x_query))

# %%
# `predict_proba` in `SelfTrainingClassifier`
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# :class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.SelfTrainingClassifier` works by repeatedly
# fitting its base estimator on the currently labeled data, then adding
# pseudo-labels for unlabeled points whose predicted probabilities exceed a
# confidence threshold. This process continues until no new points can be
# labeled, at which point the classifier has a final fitted base estimator
# stored in the attribute `estimator_`.
#
# When you call `predict_proba` on the `SelfTrainingClassifier`, it simply
# delegates to this final estimator.

st = st10[0]
print("Manual:", st.estimator_.predict_proba(x_query))
print("API   :", st.predict_proba(x_query))

# %%
# In both methods, semi-supervised learning can be understood as constructing a
# categorical distribution over classes for each sample.
# :class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelSpreading` keeps these distributions soft and
# updates them through graph-based propagation.
# Predictions (including `predict_proba`) remain tied to the training set, which
# must be stored for inference.
#
# :class:`~sklearn.semi_supervised.SelfTrainingClassifier` instead uses these
# distributions internally to decide which unlabeled points to assign pseudo-labels
# during training, but at prediction time the returned probabilities come directly from
# the final fitted estimator, and therefore the decision rule does not require storing
# the training data.
