=============================================
Effect of varying threshold for self-training
=============================================

This example illustrates the effect of a varying threshold on self-training.
The `breast_cancer` dataset is loaded, and labels are deleted such that only 50
out of 569 samples have labels. A `SelfTrainingClassifier` is fitted on this
dataset, with varying thresholds.

The upper graph shows the amount of labeled samples that the classifier has
available by the end of fit, and the accuracy of the classifier. The lower
graph shows the last iteration in which a sample was labeled. All values are
cross validated with 3 folds.

At low thresholds (in [0.4, 0.5]), the classifier learns from samples that were
labeled with a low confidence. These low-confidence samples are likely have
incorrect predicted labels, and as a result, fitting on these incorrect labels
produces a poor accuracy. Note that the classifier labels almost all of the
samples, and only takes one iteration.

For very high thresholds (in [0.9, 1)) we observe that the classifier does not
augment its dataset (the amount of self-labeled samples is 0). As a result, the
accuracy achieved with a threshold of 0.9999 is the same as a normal supervised
classifier would achieve.

The optimal accuracy lies in between both of these extremes at a threshold of
around 0.7.
