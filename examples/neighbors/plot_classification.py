Nearest Neighbors Classification

This example shows how to use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier`.
We train such a classifier on the iris dataset and observe the difference of the
decision boundary obtained with regards to the parameter `weights`.

# In this example, we use the iris dataset. We split the data into a train and test

# K-nearest neighbors classifier
# ------------------------------
#
# We want to use a k-nearest neighbors classifier considering a neighborhood of 11 data
# points. Since our k-nearest neighbors model uses euclidean distance to find the
# nearest neighbors, it is therefore important to scale the data beforehand. Refer to
# the example entitled
# :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_preprocessing_plot_scaling_importance.py` for more
# detailed information.
#
# Thus, we use a :class:`~sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` to chain a scaler before to use
# our classifier.
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

clf = Pipeline(
    steps=[("scaler", StandardScaler()), ("knn", KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=11))]

# %%
# Decision boundary
# -----------------
#
# Now, we fit two classifiers with different values of the parameter
# `weights`. We plot the decision boundary of each classifier as well as the original
# dataset to observe the difference.

# %%
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# We observe that the parameter `weights` has an impact on the decision boundary. When
# `weights="unifom"` all nearest neighbors will have the same impact on the decision.
# Whereas when `weights="distance"` the weight given to each neighbor is proportional
# to the inverse of the distance from that neighbor to the query point.
#
# In some cases, taking the distance into account might improve the model.
