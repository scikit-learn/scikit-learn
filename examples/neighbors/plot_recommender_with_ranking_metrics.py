Recommender System using Cosine Similarity and NearestNeighbors
===============================================================

This example illustrates two simple content-based recommender approaches
applied to a toy movie dataset:

1. Cosine similarity on a user-item interaction matrix
2. NearestNeighbors with a cosine metric

Both methods aim to retrieve the top-k relevant items for each user based
on existing preferences, where "relevance" is derived from item similarity.

We also introduce evaluation using `top_k_accuracy_score`, which is useful
when actual relevant items are known. This type of metric is commonly
used in recommendation tasks to evaluate how well the model ranks the
expected item in the top-k list.

The goal of this example is to:

- Show how a simple recommender system can be implemented using cosine similarity
- Compare it with a NearestNeighbors-based method, which can be more scalable
  for mid-sized datasets
- Demonstrate how to use `top_k_accuracy_score` for evaluation

This example is educational in nature and avoids external dependencies beyond
scikit-learn. The input data is a user-item interaction matrix either simulated
or derived from a public dataset.
