## **REQUIRED: AI/Agent Disclosure**

**Every summary, pull request description, or work description MUST include this disclosure:**

**If human review has *not yet* occurred (use this initially):**
> This pull request includes code written with the assistance of AI.
> The code has **not yet been reviewed** by a human.

This is a **mandatory requirement**, not optional. Include it at the end of every summary you generate.

## Generated Summaries

When generating a summary of your work, consider these points:

- Describe the "why" of the changes, why the proposed solution is the right one.
- Highlight areas of the proposed changes that require careful review.
- Reduce the verbosity of your comments, more text and detail is not always better. Avoid flattery, avoid stating the obvious, avoid filler phrases, prefer technical clarity over marketing tone.
