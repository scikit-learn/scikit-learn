# Code of Conduct

We are a community based on openness, as well as friendly and didactic discussions.

We aspire to treat everybody equally, and value their contributions.

Decisions are made based on technical merit and consensus.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests,
answering questions to help others on mailing lists or issues, organizing and
teaching tutorials, working on the website, improving the documentation, are
all priceless contributions.

We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of
the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/

# Low Quality and AI Generated Contributions Policy

Due to the burden put on maintainers, users submitting multiple low quality pull
requests, or AI generated comments, reviews, issues, or pull requests, where the
user does not show a good understanding of what they are posting, might be banned
from the organisation. Some examples of poor etiquette are:

- Opening a PR for issues which are not yet triaged and the "triage" label is not
  removed;
- Claiming to work on many issues at the same time;
- Claiming issues or opening pull requests where another person has already
  claimed it or where there's already a PR fixing the issue;
- Opening AI generated pull requests w/o understanding them;
- Leaving AI generated comments on issues and pull requests.
