def prefix_tree(paths):
    """Creates a directed prefix tree from the given list of iterables.

    Parameters
    ----------
    paths: iterable of lists
        An iterable over "paths", which are themselves lists of
        nodes. Common prefixes among these paths are converted into
        common initial segments in the generated tree.

        Most commonly, this may be an iterable over lists of integers,
        or an iterable over Python strings.

    Returns
    -------
    DiGraph
        A directed graph representing an arborescence consisting of the
        prefix tree generated by `paths`. Nodes are directed "downward",
        from parent to child. A special "synthetic" root node is added
        to be the parent of the first node in each path. A special
        "synthetic" leaf node, the "nil" node, is added to be the child
        of all nodes representing the last element in a path. (The
        addition of this nil node technically makes this not an
        arborescence but a directed acyclic graph; removing the nil node
        makes it an arborescence.)

        Each node has an attribute 'source' whose value is the original
        element of the path to which this node corresponds. The 'source'
        of the root node is None, and the 'source' of the nil node is
        :data:`.NIL`.

        The root node is the only node of in-degree zero in the graph,
        and the nil node is the only node of out-degree zero.  For
        convenience, the nil node can be accessed via the :data:`.NIL`
        attribute; for example::

            >>> from networkx.generators.trees import NIL
            >>> paths = ['ab', 'abs', 'ad']
            >>> T = nx.prefix_tree(paths)
            >>> T.predecessors(NIL)  # doctest: +SKIP

    Notes
    -----
    The prefix tree is also known as a *trie*.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a prefix tree from a list of strings with some common
    prefixes::

        >>> strings = ['ab', 'abs', 'ad']
        >>> T, root = nx.prefix_tree(strings)

    Continuing the above example, to recover the original paths that
    generated the prefix tree, traverse up the tree from the
    :data:`.NIL` node to the root::

        >>> from networkx.generators.trees import NIL
        >>>
        >>> strings = ['ab', 'abs', 'ad']
        >>> T, root = nx.prefix_tree(strings)
        >>> recovered = []
        >>> for v in T.predecessors(NIL):
        ...     s = ''
        ...     while v != root:
        ...         # Prepend the character `v` to the accumulator `s`.
        ...         s = str(T.node[v]['source']) + s
        ...         # Each non-nil, non-root node has exactly one parent.
        ...         v = next(T.predecessors(v))
        ...     recovered.append(s)
        >>> sorted(recovered)
        ['ab', 'abs', 'ad']
