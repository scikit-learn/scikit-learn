def tree_all_pairs_lowest_common_ancestor(G, root=None, pairs=None):
    r"""Yield the lowest common ancestor for sets of pairs in a tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX directed graph (must be a tree)

    root : node, optional (default: None)
        The root of the subtree to operate on.
        If None, assume the entire graph has exactly one source and use that.

    pairs : iterable or iterator of pairs of nodes, optional (default: None)
        The pairs of interest. If None, Defaults to all pairs of nodes
        under `root` that have a lowest common ancestor.

    Returns
    -------
    lcas : generator of tuples `((u, v), lca)` where `u` and `v` are nodes
        in `pairs` and `lca` is their lowest common ancestor.

    Notes
    -----
    Only defined on non-null trees represented with directed edges from
    parents to children. Uses Tarjan's off-line lowest-common-ancestors
    algorithm. Runs in time $O(4 \times (V + E + P))$ time, where 4 is the largest
    value of the inverse Ackermann function likely to ever come up in actual
    use, and $P$ is the number of pairs requested (or $V^2$ if all are needed).
