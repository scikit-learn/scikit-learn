def is_simple_path(G, nodes):
    """Returns True if and only if the given nodes form a simple path in
    `G`.

    A *simple path* in a graph is a nonempty sequence of nodes in which
    no node appears more than once in the sequence, and each adjacent
    pair of nodes in the sequence is adjacent in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nodes : list
        A list of one or more nodes in the graph `G`.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the given list of nodes represents a simple path in
        `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    A list of zero nodes is not a path and a list of one node is a
    path. Here's an explanation why.

    This function operates on *node paths*. One could also consider
    *edge paths*. There is a bijection between node paths and edge
    paths.

    The *length of a path* is the number of edges in the path, so a list
    of nodes of length *n* corresponds to a path of length *n* - 1.
    Thus the smallest edge path would be a list of zero edges, the empty
    path. This corresponds to a list of one node.

    To convert between a node path and an edge path, you can use code
    like the following::

        >>> from networkx.utils import pairwise
        >>> nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3]
        >>> edges = list(pairwise(nodes))
        >>> edges
        [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
        >>> nodes = [edges[0][0]] + [v for u, v in edges]
        >>> nodes
        [0, 1, 2, 3]

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> nx.is_simple_path(G, [2, 3, 0])
    True
    >>> nx.is_simple_path(G, [0, 2])
    False

    """
    # The empty list is not a valid path. Could also return
    # NetworkXPointlessConcept here.
    if len(nodes) == 0:
        return False
    # If the list is a single node, just check that the node is actually
    # in the graph.
    if len(nodes) == 1:
        return nodes[0] in G
    # Test that no node appears more than once, and that each
    # adjacent pair of nodes is adjacent.
    return (len(set(nodes)) == len(nodes) and
            all(v in G[u] for u, v in pairwise(nodes)))


def all_simple_paths(G, source, target, cutoff=None):
    """Generate all simple paths in the graph G from source to target.

    A simple path is a path with no repeated nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : node
       Ending node for path

    cutoff : integer, optional
        Depth to stop the search. Only paths of length <= cutoff are returned.

    Returns
    -------
    path_generator: generator
       A generator that produces lists of simple paths.  If there are no paths
       between the source and target within the given cutoff the generator
       produces no output.

    Examples
    --------
    This iterator generates lists of nodes::

        >>> G = nx.complete_graph(4)
        >>> for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3):
        ...     print(path)
        ...
        [0, 1, 2, 3]
        [0, 1, 3]
        [0, 2, 1, 3]
        [0, 2, 3]
        [0, 3]

    You can generate only those paths that are shorter than a certain
    length by using the `cutoff` keyword argument::

        >>> paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3, cutoff=2)
        >>> print(list(paths))
        [[0, 1, 3], [0, 2, 3], [0, 3]]

    To get each path as the corresponding list of edges, you can use the
    :func:`networkx.utils.pairwise` helper function::

        >>> paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3)
        >>> for path in map(nx.utils.pairwise, paths):
        ...     print(list(path))
        [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
        [(0, 1), (1, 3)]
        [(0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3)]
        [(0, 2), (2, 3)]
        [(0, 3)]

    Iterate over each path from the root nodes to the leaf nodes in a
    directed acyclic graph using a functional programming approach::

        >>> from itertools import chain
        >>> from itertools import product
        >>> from itertools import starmap
        >>> from functools import partial
        >>>
        >>> chaini = chain.from_iterable
        >>>
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (3, 2)])
        >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> leaves = (v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> all_paths = partial(nx.all_simple_paths, G)
        >>> list(chaini(starmap(all_paths, product(roots, leaves))))
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]

    The same list computed using an iterative approach::

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (3, 2)])
        >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> leaves = (v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> all_paths = []
        >>> for root in roots:
        ...     for leaf in leaves:
        ...         paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, root, leaf)
        ...         all_paths.extend(paths)
        >>> all_paths
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm uses a modified depth-first search to generate the
    paths [1]_.  A single path can be found in $O(V+E)$ time but the
    number of simple paths in a graph can be very large, e.g. $O(n!)$ in
    the complete graph of order $n$.

    """Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths using bidirectional search.

    This function returns the shortest path between source and target
    ignoring nodes and edges in the containers ignore_nodes and
    ignore_edges.

    This is a custom modification of the standard Dijkstra bidirectional
    shortest path implementation at networkx.algorithms.weighted

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node.

    target : node
       Ending node.

    weight: string, optional (default='weight')
       Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight

    ignore_nodes : container of nodes
       nodes to ignore, optional

    ignore_edges : container of edges
       edges to ignore, optional

    Returns
    -------
    length : number
        Shortest path length.

    Returns a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by node.
    The first dictionary stores distance from the source.
    The second stores the path from the source to that node.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    In practice  bidirectional Dijkstra is much more than twice as fast as
    ordinary Dijkstra.

    Ordinary Dijkstra expands nodes in a sphere-like manner from the
    source. The radius of this sphere will eventually be the length
    of the shortest path. Bidirectional Dijkstra will expand nodes
    from both the source and the target, making two spheres of half
    this radius. Volume of the first sphere is pi*r*r while the
    others are 2*pi*r/2*r/2, making up half the volume.

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
    are negative or are floating point numbers
    (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).
