    To obtain a list of all cliques, use

    The implementation is adapted from the algorithm by Zhang, et

    This algorithm ignores self-loops and parallel edges, since cliques

    For each node *v*, a *maximal clique for v* is a largest complete

    called the *maximum clique*.

    This function returns an iterator over cliques, each of which is a

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    Returns
    -------
    iterator
        An iterator over maximal cliques, each of which is a list of

    -----
    To obtain a list of all maximal cliques, use

    This implementation is based on the algorithm published by Bron and

    (2006) [2]_ and discussed in Cazals and Karande (2008) [3]_. It
    essentially unrolls the recursion used in the references to avoid
    issues of recursion stack depth (for a recursive implementation, see
    :func:`find_cliques_recursive`).

    This algorithm ignores self-loops and parallel edges, since cliques
    are not conventionally defined with such edges.
