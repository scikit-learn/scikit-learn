# These tests can fail with hash randomization. The easiest and clearest way
# to write these unit tests is for the edges to be output in an expected total
# order, but we cannot guarantee the order amongst outgoing edges from a node,
# unless each class uses an ordered data structure for neighbors. This is
# painful to do with the current API. The alternative is that the tests are
# written (IMO confusingly) so that there is not a total order over the edges,
# but only a partial order. Due to the small size of the graphs, hopefully
# failures due to hash randomization will not occur. For an example of how
# this can fail, see TestEdgeDFS.test_multigraph.
