"""Functions concerning tournament graphs.

A `tournament graph`_ is a complete oriented graph. In other words, it
is a directed graph in which there is exactly one directed edge joining
each pair of distinct nodes. For each function in this module that
accepts a graph as input, you must provide a tournament graph. The
responsibility is on the caller to ensure that the graph is a tournament
graph.

To access the functions in this module, you must access them through the
:mod:`networkx.algorithms.tournament` module::

    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import tournament
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)])
    >>> tournament.is_tournament(G)
    True

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
