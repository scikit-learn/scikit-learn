# Blacklisted imperative words
#
# These are words that, if they begin a docstring, are a good indicator that
# the docstring is not written in an imperative voice.
#
# The words included in this list fall into a number of categories:
#
# - Starting with a noun/pronoun indicates that the docstring is a noun phrase
#   or a sentence but not in the imperative mood
# - Adjectives are always followed by a noun, so same
# - Particles are also followed by a noun
# - Some adverbs don't really indicate an imperative sentence, for example
#   "importantly" or "currently".
# - Some irregular verb forms that don't stem to the same string as the
#   imperative does (eg. 'does')
