    This is a version of the Chan-Vese algorithm that uses morphological
    operators instead of solving a partial differential equation (PDE) for the
    evolution of the contour. The set of morphological operators used in this
    algorithm are proved to be infinitesimally equivalent to the Chan-Vese PDE
    (see [1]_). However, morphological operators are do not suffer from the
    numerical stability issues typically found in PDEs (it is not necessary to
    find the right time step for the evolution), and are computationally
    faster.

    The algorithm and its theoretical derivation are described in [1]_.

    ----------
    gimage : (M, N) or (L, M, N) array
        Preprocessed image or volume to be segmented. This is very rarely the

        evolution in areas where `gimage` is small. See
        `morphsnakes.inverse_gaussian_gradient` as an example function to
        perform this preprocessing. Note that the quality of
        `morphological_geodesic_active_contour` might greatly depend on this
        preprocessing.
    iterations : uint
        Number of iterations to run.
    init_level_set : str, (M, N) array, or (L, M, N) array

    smoothing : uint, optional
        Number of times the smoothing operator is applied per iteration.
        Reasonable values are around 1-4. Larger values lead to smoother
        segmentations.
    threshold : float, optional
        Areas of the image with a value smaller than this threshold will be
        considered borders. The evolution of the contour will stop in this
        areas.
    balloon : float, optional
        Balloon force to guide the contour in non-informative areas of the
        image, i.e., areas where the gradient of the image is too small to push
        the contour towards a border. A negative value will shrink the contour,
        while a positive value will expand the contour in these areas. Setting
        this to zero will disable the balloon force.
    iter_callback : function, optional
        If given, this function is called once per iteration with the current
        level set as the only argument. This is useful for debugging or for
