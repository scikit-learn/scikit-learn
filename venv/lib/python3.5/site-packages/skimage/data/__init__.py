    The two images are rectified such that every pixel in the left image has
    its corresponding pixel on the same scanline in the right image. That means
    that both images are warped such that they have the same orientation but a
    horizontal spatial offset (baseline). The ground-truth pixel offset in
    column direction is specified by the included disparity map.

    The two images are part of the Middlebury 2014 stereo benchmark. The
    dataset was created by Nera Nesic, Porter Westling, Xi Wang, York Kitajima,
    Greg Krathwohl, and Daniel Scharstein at Middlebury College. A detailed
    description of the acquisition process can be found in [1]_.

    The images included here are down-sampled versions of the default exposure
    images in the benchmark. The images are down-sampled by a factor of 4 using
    the function `skimage.transform.downscale_local_mean`. The calibration data
    in the following and the included ground-truth disparity map are valid for
    the down-sampled images::

        Focal length:           994.978px

        Principal point y:      254.877px

    img_left : (500, 741, 3) uint8 ndarray

    img_right : (500, 741, 3) uint8 ndarray
        Right stereo image.
    disp : (500, 741, 3) float ndarray
        Ground-truth disparity map, where each value describes the offset in
        column direction between corresponding pixels in the left and the right
        stereo images. E.g. the corresponding pixel of
        ``img_left[10, 10 + disp[10, 10]]`` is ``img_right[10, 10]``.
        NaNs denote pixels in the left image that do not have ground-truth.
