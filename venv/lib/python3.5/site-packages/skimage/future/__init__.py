"""Functionality with an experimental API. Although you can count on the
functions in this package being around in the future, the API may change with
any version update **and will not follow the skimage two-version deprecation
path**. Therefore, use the functions herein with care, and do not use them in
production code that will depend on updated skimage versions.
