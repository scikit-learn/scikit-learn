'''Pexpect is a Python module for spawning child applications and controlling
them automatically. Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications
such as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup
scripts for duplicating software package installations on different servers. It
can be used for automated software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of Don
Libes' Expect, but Pexpect is pure Python. Other Expect-like modules for Python
require TCL and Expect or require C extensions to be compiled. Pexpect does not
use C, Expect, or TCL extensions. It should work on any platform that supports
the standard Python pty module. The Pexpect interface focuses on ease of use so
that simple tasks are easy.

There are two main interfaces to the Pexpect system; these are the function,
run() and the class, spawn. The spawn class is more powerful. The run()
function is simpler than spawn, and is good for quickly calling program. When
you call the run() function it executes a given program and then returns the
output. This is a handy replacement for os.system().

For example::

    pexpect.run('ls -la')

The spawn class is the more powerful interface to the Pexpect system. You can
use this to spawn a child program then interact with it by sending input and
expecting responses (waiting for patterns in the child's output).

For example::

    child = pexpect.spawn('scp foo user@example.com:.')
    child.expect('Password:')
    child.sendline(mypassword)

This works even for commands that ask for passwords or other input outside of
the normal stdio streams. For example, ssh reads input directly from the TTY
device which bypasses stdin.
