class pxssh (spawn):
    '''This class extends pexpect.spawn to specialize setting up SSH
    connections. This adds methods for login, logout, and expecting the shell
    prompt. It does various tricky things to handle many situations in the SSH
    login process. For example, if the session is your first login, then pxssh
    automatically accepts the remote certificate; or if you have public key
    authentication setup then pxssh won't wait for the password prompt.

    pxssh uses the shell prompt to synchronize output from the remote host. In
    order to make this more robust it sets the shell prompt to something more
    unique than just $ or #. This should work on most Borne/Bash or Csh style
    shells.

    Example that runs a few commands on a remote server and prints the result::

        from pexpect import pxssh
        import getpass
        try:
            s = pxssh.pxssh()
            hostname = raw_input('hostname: ')
            username = raw_input('username: ')
            password = getpass.getpass('password: ')
            s.login(hostname, username, password)
            s.sendline('uptime')   # run a command
            s.prompt()             # match the prompt
            print(s.before)        # print everything before the prompt.
            s.sendline('ls -l')
            s.prompt()
            print(s.before)
            s.sendline('df')
            s.prompt()
            print(s.before)
            s.logout()
        except pxssh.ExceptionPxssh as e:
            print("pxssh failed on login.")
            print(e)

    Example showing how to specify SSH options::

        from pexpect import pxssh
        s = pxssh.pxssh(options={
                            "StrictHostKeyChecking": "no",
                            "UserKnownHostsFile": "/dev/null"})
        ...

    Note that if you have ssh-agent running while doing development with pxssh
    then this can lead to a lot of confusion. Many X display managers (xdm,
    gdm, kdm, etc.) will automatically start a GUI agent. You may see a GUI
    dialog box popup asking for a password during development. You should turn
    off any key agents during testing. The 'force_password' attribute will turn
    off public key authentication. This will only work if the remote SSH server
    is configured to allow password logins. Example of using 'force_password'
    attribute::

            s = pxssh.pxssh()
            s.force_password = True
            hostname = raw_input('hostname: ')
            username = raw_input('username: ')
            password = getpass.getpass('password: ')
            s.login (hostname, username, password)
    
    `debug_command_string` is only for the test suite to confirm that the string
    generated for SSH is correct, using this will not allow you to do
    anything other than get a string back from `pxssh.pxssh.login()`.

        It uses
        'original_prompt' to try to find the prompt right after login. When it
        finds the prompt it immediately tries to reset the prompt to something
        more easily matched. The default 'original_prompt' is very optimistic
        and is easily fooled. It's more reliable to try to match the original
        prompt as exactly as possible to prevent false matches by server
        strings such as the "Message Of The Day". On many systems you can
        disable the MOTD on the remote server by creating a zero-length file
        called :file:`~/.hushlogin` on the remote server. If a prompt cannot be found
        then this will not necessarily cause the login to fail. In the case of
        a timeout when looking for the prompt we assume that the original
        prompt was so weird that we could not match it, so we use a few tricks
        to guess when we have reached the prompt. Then we hope for the best and
        blindly try to reset the prompt to something more unique. If that fails
        then login() raises an :class:`ExceptionPxssh` exception.

        In some situations it is not possible or desirable to reset the
        original prompt. In this case, pass ``auto_prompt_reset=False`` to
        inhibit setting the prompt to the UNIQUE_PROMPT. Remember that pxssh
        uses a unique prompt in the :meth:`prompt` method. If the original prompt is
        not reset then this will disable the :meth:`prompt` method unless you
        manually set the :attr:`PROMPT` attribute.
        
        Set ``password_regex`` if there is a MOTD message with `password` in it.
        Changing this is like playing in traffic, don't (p)expect it to match straight
        away.
        
        If you require to connect to another SSH server from the your original SSH
        connection set ``spawn_local_ssh`` to `False` and this will use your current
        session to do so. Setting this option to `False` and not having an active session
        will trigger an error.
        
        Set ``ssh_key`` to `True` to force passing the current SSH authentication socket to the

        This is little more than a short-cut to the :meth:`~pexpect.spawn.expect`
        method. Note that if you called :meth:`login` with
        ``auto_prompt_reset=False``, then before calling :meth:`prompt` you must
        set the :attr:`PROMPT` attribute to a regex that it will use for
        matching the prompt.

        Calling :meth:`prompt` will erase the contents of the :attr:`before`
        attribute even if no prompt is ever matched. If timeout is not given or
        it is set to -1 then self.timeout is used.

        :return: True if the shell prompt was matched, False if the timeout was
                 reached.

        This makes it easier for the :meth:`prompt` method to match the shell prompt
        unambiguously. This method is called automatically by the :meth:`login`
        method, but you may want to call it manually if you somehow reset the
        shell prompt. For example, if you 'su' to a different user then you
        will need to manually reset the prompt. This sends shell commands to
        the remote host to set the prompt, so this assumes the remote host is
        ready to receive commands.

        Alternatively, you may use your own prompt pattern. In this case you
        should call :meth:`login` with ``auto_prompt_reset=False``; then set the
        :attr:`PROMPT` attribute to a regular expression. After that, the
        :meth:`prompt` method will try to match your prompt pattern.
