    """
    Compute a definite integral.

    Integrate func from `a` to `b` (possibly infinite interval) using a
    technique from the Fortran library QUADPACK.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : {function, scipy.LowLevelCallable}
        A Python function or method to integrate.  If `func` takes many
        arguments, it is integrated along the axis corresponding to the
        first argument.

        If the user desires improved integration performance, then `f` may
        be a `scipy.LowLevelCallable` with one of the signatures::

            double func(double x)
            double func(double x, void *user_data)
            double func(int n, double *xx)
            double func(int n, double *xx, void *user_data)

        The ``user_data`` is the data contained in the `scipy.LowLevelCallable`.
        In the call forms with ``xx``,  ``n`` is the length of the ``xx``
        array which contains ``xx[0] == x`` and the rest of the items are
        numbers contained in the ``args`` argument of quad.

        In addition, certain ctypes call signatures are supported for
        backward compatibility, but those should not be used in new code.
    a : float
        Lower limit of integration (use -numpy.inf for -infinity).
    b : float
        Upper limit of integration (use numpy.inf for +infinity).
    args : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments to pass to `func`.
    full_output : int, optional
        Non-zero to return a dictionary of integration information.
        If non-zero, warning messages are also suppressed and the
        message is appended to the output tuple.

    Returns
    -------
    y : float
        The integral of func from `a` to `b`.
    abserr : float
        An estimate of the absolute error in the result.
    infodict : dict
        A dictionary containing additional information.
        Run scipy.integrate.quad_explain() for more information.
    message
        A convergence message.
    explain
        Appended only with 'cos' or 'sin' weighting and infinite
        integration limits, it contains an explanation of the codes in
        infodict['ierlst']

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    epsabs : float or int, optional
        Absolute error tolerance.
    epsrel : float or int, optional
        Relative error tolerance.
    limit : float or int, optional
        An upper bound on the number of subintervals used in the adaptive
        algorithm.
    points : (sequence of floats,ints), optional
        A sequence of break points in the bounded integration interval
        where local difficulties of the integrand may occur (e.g.,
        singularities, discontinuities). The sequence does not have
        to be sorted.
    weight : float or int, optional
        String indicating weighting function. Full explanation for this
        and the remaining arguments can be found below.
    wvar : optional
        Variables for use with weighting functions.
    wopts : optional
        Optional input for reusing Chebyshev moments.
    maxp1 : float or int, optional
        An upper bound on the number of Chebyshev moments.

        Upper bound on the number of cycles (>=3) for use with a sinusoidal
        weighting and an infinite end-point.

    **Extra information for quad() inputs and outputs**

    If full_output is non-zero, then the third output argument
    (infodict) is a dictionary with entries as tabulated below.  For
    infinite limits, the range is transformed to (0,1) and the
    optional outputs are given with respect to this transformed range.
    Let M be the input argument limit and let K be infodict['last'].
    The entries are:

    'neval'
        The number of function evaluations.
    'last'
        The number, K, of subintervals produced in the subdivision process.
    'alist'
        A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the
        left end points of the subintervals in the partition of the
        integration range.
    'blist'
        A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the
        right end points of the subintervals.
    'rlist'
        A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the
        integral approximations on the subintervals.
    'elist'
        A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the
        moduli of the absolute error estimates on the subintervals.
    'iord'
        A rank-1 integer array of length M, the first L elements of
        which are pointers to the error estimates over the subintervals
        with ``L=K`` if ``K<=M/2+2`` or ``L=M+1-K`` otherwise. Let I be the
        sequence ``infodict['iord']`` and let E be the sequence
        ``infodict['elist']``.  Then ``E[I[1]], ..., E[I[L]]`` forms a
        decreasing sequence.

    If the input argument points is provided (i.e. it is not None),
    the following additional outputs are placed in the output
    dictionary.  Assume the points sequence is of length P.

    'pts'
        A rank-1 array of length P+2 containing the integration limits
        and the break points of the intervals in ascending order.
        This is an array giving the subintervals over which integration
        will occur.
    'level'
        A rank-1 integer array of length M (=limit), containing the
        subdivision levels of the subintervals, i.e., if (aa,bb) is a
        subinterval of ``(pts[1], pts[2])`` where ``pts[0]`` and ``pts[2]``
        are adjacent elements of ``infodict['pts']``, then (aa,bb) has level l
        if ``|bb-aa| = |pts[2]-pts[1]| * 2**(-l)``.
    'ndin'
        A rank-1 integer array of length P+2.  After the first integration
        over the intervals (pts[1], pts[2]), the error estimates over some
        of the intervals may have been increased artificially in order to
        put their subdivision forward.  This array has ones in slots
        corresponding to the subintervals for which this happens.

    **Weighting the integrand**

    The input variables, *weight* and *wvar*, are used to weight the
    integrand by a select list of functions.  Different integration
    methods are used to compute the integral with these weighting
    functions.  The possible values of weight and the corresponding
    weighting functions are.

    ==========  ===================================   =====================
    ``weight``  Weight function used                  ``wvar``
    ==========  ===================================   =====================
    'cos'       cos(w*x)                              wvar = w
    'sin'       sin(w*x)                              wvar = w
    'alg'       g(x) = ((x-a)**alpha)*((b-x)**beta)   wvar = (alpha, beta)
    'alg-loga'  g(x)*log(x-a)                         wvar = (alpha, beta)
    'alg-logb'  g(x)*log(b-x)                         wvar = (alpha, beta)
    'alg-log'   g(x)*log(x-a)*log(b-x)                wvar = (alpha, beta)
    'cauchy'    1/(x-c)                               wvar = c
    ==========  ===================================   =====================

    wvar holds the parameter w, (alpha, beta), or c depending on the weight
    selected.  In these expressions, a and b are the integration limits.

    For the 'cos' and 'sin' weighting, additional inputs and outputs are
    available.

    For finite integration limits, the integration is performed using a
    Clenshaw-Curtis method which uses Chebyshev moments.  For repeated
    calculations, these moments are saved in the output dictionary:

    'momcom'
        The maximum level of Chebyshev moments that have been computed,
        i.e., if ``M_c`` is ``infodict['momcom']`` then the moments have been
        computed for intervals of length ``|b-a| * 2**(-l)``,
        ``l=0,1,...,M_c``.
    'nnlog'
        A rank-1 integer array of length M(=limit), containing the
        subdivision levels of the subintervals, i.e., an element of this
        array is equal to l if the corresponding subinterval is
        ``|b-a|* 2**(-l)``.
    'chebmo'
        A rank-2 array of shape (25, maxp1) containing the computed
        Chebyshev moments.  These can be passed on to an integration
        over the same interval by passing this array as the second
        element of the sequence wopts and passing infodict['momcom'] as
        the first element.

    If one of the integration limits is infinite, then a Fourier integral is
    computed (assuming w neq 0).  If full_output is 1 and a numerical error
    is encountered, besides the error message attached to the output tuple,
    a dictionary is also appended to the output tuple which translates the
    error codes in the array ``info['ierlst']`` to English messages.  The
    output information dictionary contains the following entries instead of
    'last', 'alist', 'blist', 'rlist', and 'elist':

    'lst'
        The number of subintervals needed for the integration (call it ``K_f``).
    'rslst'
        A rank-1 array of length M_f=limlst, whose first ``K_f`` elements
        contain the integral contribution over the interval
        ``(a+(k-1)c, a+kc)`` where ``c = (2*floor(|w|) + 1) * pi / |w|``
        and ``k=1,2,...,K_f``.
    'erlst'
        A rank-1 array of length ``M_f`` containing the error estimate
        corresponding to the interval in the same position in
        ``infodict['rslist']``.
    'ierlst'
        A rank-1 integer array of length ``M_f`` containing an error flag
        corresponding to the interval in the same position in
        ``infodict['rslist']``.  See the explanation dictionary (last entry
        in the output tuple) for the meaning of the codes.

    Examples
    --------
    Calculate :math:`\\int^4_0 x^2 dx` and compare with an analytic result

    >>> from scipy import integrate
    >>> x2 = lambda x: x**2
    >>> integrate.quad(x2, 0, 4)
    (21.333333333333332, 2.3684757858670003e-13)
    >>> print(4**3 / 3.)  # analytical result
    21.3333333333

    Calculate :math:`\\int^\\infty_0 e^{-x} dx`

    >>> invexp = lambda x: np.exp(-x)
    >>> integrate.quad(invexp, 0, np.inf)
    (1.0, 5.842605999138044e-11)

    >>> f = lambda x,a : a*x
    >>> y, err = integrate.quad(f, 0, 1, args=(1,))
    >>> y
    0.5
    >>> y, err = integrate.quad(f, 0, 1, args=(3,))
    >>> y
    1.5

    Calculate :math:`\\int^1_0 x^2 + y^2 dx` with ctypes, holding
    y parameter as 1::

        testlib.c =>
            double func(int n, double args[n]){
                return args[0]*args[0] + args[1]*args[1];}
        compile to library testlib.*

    ::

       from scipy import integrate
       import ctypes
       lib = ctypes.CDLL('/home/.../testlib.*') #use absolute path
       lib.func.restype = ctypes.c_double
       lib.func.argtypes = (ctypes.c_int,ctypes.c_double)
       integrate.quad(lib.func,0,1,(1))
       #(1.3333333333333333, 1.4802973661668752e-14)
       print((1.0**3/3.0 + 1.0) - (0.0**3/3.0 + 0.0)) #Analytic result
       # 1.3333333333333333

    Be aware that pulse shapes and other sharp features as compared to the
    size of the integration interval may not be integrated correctly using
    this method. A simplified example of this limitation is integrating a
    y-axis reflected step function with many zero values within the integrals
    bounds.

    >>> y = lambda x: 1 if x<=0 else 0
    >>> integrate.quad(y, -1, 1)

    Integration over multiple variables.

    Wraps `quad` to enable integration over multiple variables.
    Various options allow improved integration of discontinuous functions, as
    well as the use of weighted integration, and generally finer control of the
    integration process.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : {callable, scipy.LowLevelCallable}
        The function to be integrated. Has arguments of ``x0, ... xn``,
        ``t0, tm``, where integration is carried out over ``x0, ... xn``, which
        must be floats.  Function signature should be
        ``func(x0, x1, ..., xn, t0, t1, ..., tm)``.  Integration is carried out
        in order.  That is, integration over ``x0`` is the innermost integral,
        and ``xn`` is the outermost.

        If the user desires improved integration performance, then `f` may
        be a `scipy.LowLevelCallable` with one of the signatures::

            double func(int n, double *xx)
            double func(int n, double *xx, void *user_data)

        where ``n`` is the number of extra parameters and args is an array
        of doubles of the additional parameters, the ``xx`` array contains the
        coordinates. The ``user_data`` is the data contained in the
        `scipy.LowLevelCallable`.
    ranges : iterable object
        Each element of ranges may be either a sequence  of 2 numbers, or else
        a callable that returns such a sequence.  ``ranges[0]`` corresponds to
        integration over x0, and so on.  If an element of ranges is a callable,
        then it will be called with all of the integration arguments available,
        as well as any parametric arguments. e.g. if
        ``func = f(x0, x1, x2, t0, t1)``, then ``ranges[0]`` may be defined as
        either ``(a, b)`` or else as ``(a, b) = range0(x1, x2, t0, t1)``.
    args : iterable object, optional
        Additional arguments ``t0, ..., tn``, required by `func`, `ranges`, and
        ``opts``.
    opts : iterable object or dict, optional
        Options to be passed to `quad`.  May be empty, a dict, or
        a sequence of dicts or functions that return a dict.  If empty, the
        default options from scipy.integrate.quad are used.  If a dict, the same
        options are used for all levels of integraion.  If a sequence, then each
        element of the sequence corresponds to a particular integration. e.g.
        opts[0] corresponds to integration over x0, and so on. If a callable,
        the signature must be the same as for ``ranges``. The available
        options together with their default values are:

          - epsabs = 1.49e-08
          - epsrel = 1.49e-08
          - limit  = 50
          - points = None
          - weight = None
          - wvar   = None
          - wopts  = None

        For more information on these options, see `quad` and `quad_explain`.

    full_output : bool, optional
        Partial implementation of ``full_output`` from scipy.integrate.quad.
        The number of integrand function evaluations ``neval`` can be obtained
        by setting ``full_output=True`` when calling nquad.

    Returns
    -------
    result : float
        The result of the integration.
    abserr : float
        The maximum of the estimates of the absolute error in the various
        integration results.
    out_dict : dict, optional
        A dict containing additional information on the integration.
