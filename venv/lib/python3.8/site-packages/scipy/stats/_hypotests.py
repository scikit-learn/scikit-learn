    Test the null hypothesis that two samples have the same underlying

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array-like
        The two samples of observations to be tested. Input must not have more
        than one dimension. Samples can have different lengths.
    t : array-like, optional
        The points (t1, ..., tn) where the empirical characteristic function is
        to be evaluated. It should be positive distinct numbers. The default
        value (0.4, 0.8) is proposed in [1]_. Input must not have more than
        one dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float
        The test statistic.
    pvalue : float
        The associated p-value based on the asymptotic chi2-distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    Testing whether two samples are generated by the same underlying
    distribution is a classical question in statistics. A widely used test is
    the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test which relies on the empirical
    distribution function. Epps and Singleton introduce a test based on the
    empirical characteristic function in [1]_.

    One advantage of the ES test compared to the KS test is that is does
    not assume a continuous distribution. In [1]_, the authors conclude
    that the test also has a higher power than the KS test in many
    examples. They recommend the use of the ES test for discrete samples as
    well as continuous samples with at least 25 observations each, whereas
    `anderson_ksamp` is recommended for smaller sample sizes in the
    continuous case.

    The p-value is computed from the asymptotic distribution of the test
    statistic which follows a `chi2` distribution. If the sample size of both
    `x` and `y` is below 25, the small sample correction proposed in [1]_ is
    applied to the test statistic.

    The default values of `t` are determined in [1]_ by considering
    various distributions and finding good values that lead to a high power
    of the test in general. Table III in [1]_ gives the optimal values for
    the distributions tested in that study. The values of `t` are scaled by
    the semi-interquartile range in the implementation, see [1]_.

    Examples
    --------

    Suppose we wish to test whether data generated by ``scipy.stats.norm.rvs``
    were, in fact, drawn from the standard normal distribution. We choose a
    significance level of alpha=0.05.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=500, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(x, 'norm')
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.49121480855028343, 0.04189256516661377)

    The p-value 0.79 exceeds our chosen significance level, so we do not
    reject the null hypothesis that the observed sample is drawn from the
    standard normal distribution.

    Now suppose we wish to check whether the same samples shifted by 2.1 is
    consistent with being drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 2.

    >>> y = x + 2.1
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(y, 'norm', args=(2,))
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.07400330012187435, 0.7274595666160468)

    Here we have used the `args` keyword to specify the mean (``loc``)
    of the normal distribution to test the data against. This is equivalent
    to the following, in which we create a frozen normal distribution with
    mean 2.1, then pass its ``cdf`` method as an argument.

    >>> frozen_dist = stats.norm(loc=2)
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(y, frozen_dist.cdf)
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.07400330012187435, 0.7274595666160468)

    In either case, we would reject the null hypothesis that the observed
    sample is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 2 (and default
    variance of 1) because the p-value 0.04 is less than our chosen
    significance level.

def somersd(x, y=None, alternative="two-sided"):
    r"""Calculates Somers' D, an asymmetric measure of ordinal association.

    Like Kendall's :math:`\tau`, Somers' :math:`D` is a measure of the
    correspondence between two rankings. Both statistics consider the
    difference between the number of concordant and discordant pairs in two
    rankings :math:`X` and :math:`Y`, and both are normalized such that values
    close  to 1 indicate strong agreement and values close to -1 indicate
    strong disagreement. They differ in how they are normalized. To show the
    relationship, Somers' :math:`D` can be defined in terms of Kendall's
    :math:`\tau_a`:

    .. math::
        D(Y|X) = \frac{\tau_a(X, Y)}{\tau_a(X, X)}

    Suppose the first ranking :math:`X` has :math:`r` distinct ranks and the
    second ranking :math:`Y` has :math:`s` distinct ranks. These two lists of
    :math:`n` rankings can also be viewed as an :math:`r \times s` contingency
    table in which element :math:`i, j` is the number of rank pairs with rank
    :math:`i` in ranking :math:`X` and rank :math:`j` in ranking :math:`Y`.
    Accordingly, `somersd` also allows the input data to be supplied as a
    single, 2D contingency table instead of as two separate, 1D rankings.

    Note that the definition of Somers' :math:`D` is asymmetric: in general,
    :math:`D(Y|X) \neq D(X|Y)`. ``somersd(x, y)`` calculates Somers'
    :math:`D(Y|X)`: the "row" variable :math:`X` is treated as an independent
    variable, and the "column" variable :math:`Y` is dependent. For Somers'
    :math:`D(X|Y)`, swap the input lists or transpose the input table.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array_like
        1D array of rankings, treated as the (row) independent variable.
        Alternatively, a 2D contingency table.
    y: array_like, optional
        If `x` is a 1D array of rankings, `y` is a 1D array of rankings of the
        same length, treated as the (column) dependent variable.
        If `x` is 2D, `y` is ignored.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis. Default is 'two-sided'.
        The following options are available:
        * 'two-sided': the rank correlation is nonzero
        * 'less': the rank correlation is negative (less than zero)
        * 'greater':  the rank correlation is positive (greater than zero)

               provided contingency table, if `x` is a 2D array)

    Notes
    -----
    This function follows the contingency table approach of [2]_ and
    [3]_. *p*-values are computed based on an asymptotic approximation of
    the test statistic distribution under the null hypothesis :math:`D=0`.

    Theoretically, hypothesis tests based on Kendall's :math:`tau` and Somers'
    :math:`D` should be identical.
    However, the *p*-values returned by `kendalltau` are based
    on the null hypothesis of *independence* between :math:`X` and :math:`Y`
    (i.e. the population from which pairs in :math:`X` and :math:`Y` are
    sampled contains equal numbers of all possible pairs), which is more
    specific than the null hypothesis :math:`D=0` used here. If the null
    hypothesis of independence is desired, it is acceptable to use the
    *p*-value returned by `kendalltau` with the statistic returned by
    `somersd` and vice versa. For more information, see [2]_.

    Contingency tables are formatted according to the convention used by
    SAS and R: the first ranking supplied (``x``) is the "row" variable, and
    the second ranking supplied (``y``) is the "column" variable. This is
    opposite the convention of Somers' original paper [1]_.

    Examples
    --------
    We calculate Somers' D for the example given in [4]_, in which a hotel
    chain owner seeks to determine the association between hotel room
    cleanliness and customer satisfaction. The independent variable, hotel
    room cleanliness, is ranked on an ordinal scale: "below average (1)",
    "average (2)", or "above average (3)". The dependent variable, customer
    satisfaction, is ranked on a second scale: "very dissatisfied (1)",
    "moderately dissatisfied (2)", "neither dissatisfied nor satisfied (3)",
    "moderately satisfied (4)", or "very satisfied (5)". 189 customers
    respond to the survey, and the results are cast into a contingency table
    with the hotel room cleanliness as the "row" variable and customer
    satisfaction as the "column" variable.

    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     | (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) |
    +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
    | (1) | 27  | 25  | 14  | 7   | 0   |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    | (2) | 7   | 14  | 18  | 35  | 12  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    | (3) | 1   | 3   | 2   | 7   | 17  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

    For example, 27 customers assigned their room a cleanliness ranking of
    "below average (1)" and a corresponding satisfaction of "very
    dissatisfied (1)". We perform the analysis as follows.

    >>> from scipy.stats import somersd
    >>> table = [[27, 25, 14, 7, 0], [7, 14, 18, 35, 12], [1, 3, 2, 7, 17]]
    >>> res = somersd(table)
    >>> res.statistic
    0.6032766111513396
    >>> res.pvalue
    1.0007091191074533e-27

    The value of the Somers' D statistic is approximately 0.6, indicating
    a positive correlation between room cleanliness and customer satisfaction
    in the sample.
    The *p*-value is very small, indicating a very small probability of
    observing such an extreme value of the statistic under the null
    hypothesis that the statistic of the entire population (from which
    our sample of 189 customers is drawn) is zero. This supports the
    alternative hypothesis that the true value of Somers' D for the population
    is nonzero.

    Notes
    -----
    Barnard's test is an exact test used in the analysis of contingency
    tables. It examines the association of two categorical variables, and
    is a more powerful alternative than Fisher's exact test
    for 2x2 contingency tables.

    Let's define :math:`X_0` a 2x2 matrix representing the observed sample,
    where each column stores the binomial experiment, as in the example
    below. Let's also define :math:`p_1, p_2` the theoretical binomial
    probabilities for  :math:`x_{11}` and :math:`x_{12}`. When using
    Barnard exact test, we can assert three different null hypotheses :

    - :math:`H_0 : p_1 \geq p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 < p_2`,
      with `alternative` = "less"

    - :math:`H_0 : p_1 \leq p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 > p_2`,
      with `alternative` = "greater"

    - :math:`H_0 : p_1 = p_2` versus :math:`H_1 : p_1 \neq p_2`,
      with `alternative` = "two-sided" (default one)

    In order to compute Barnard's exact test, we are using the Wald
    statistic [3]_ with pooled or unpooled variance.
    Under the default assumption that both variances are equal
    (``pooled = True``), the statistic is computed as:

    .. math::

        T(X) = \frac{
            \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2
        }{
            \sqrt{
                \hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})
                (\frac{1}{c_1} +
                \frac{1}{c_2})
            }
        }

    with :math:`\hat{p}_1, \hat{p}_2` and :math:`\hat{p}` the estimator of
    :math:`p_1, p_2` and :math:`p`, the latter being the combined probability,
    given the assumption that :math:`p_1 = p_2`.

    If this assumption is invalid (``pooled = False``), the statistic is:

    .. math::

        T(X) = \frac{
            \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2
        }{
            \sqrt{
                \frac{\hat{p}_1 (1 - \hat{p}_1)}{c_1} +
                \frac{\hat{p}_2 (1 - \hat{p}_2)}{c_2}
            }
        }

    The p-value is then computed as:

    .. math::

        \sum
            \binom{c_1}{x_{11}}
            \binom{c_2}{x_{12}}
            \pi^{x_{11} + x_{12}}
            (1 - \pi)^{t - x_{11} - x_{12}}

    where the sum is over all  2x2 contingency tables :math:`X` such that:
    * :math:`T(X) \leq T(X_0)` when `alternative` = "less",
    * :math:`T(X) \geq T(X_0)` when `alternative` = "greater", or
    * :math:`T(X) \geq |T(X_0)|` when `alternative` = "two-sided".
    Above, :math:`c_1, c_2` are the sum of the columns 1 and 2,
    and :math:`t` the total (sum of the 4 sample's element).

    The returned p-value is the maximum p-value taken over the nuisance
    parameter :math:`\pi`, where :math:`0 \leq \pi \leq 1`.

    This function's complexity is :math:`O(n c_1 c_2)`, where `n` is the
    number of sample points.

    Examples
    --------
    An example use of Barnard's test is presented in [2]_.

        Consider the following example of a vaccine efficacy study
        (Chan, 1998). In a randomized clinical trial of 30 subjects, 15 were
        inoculated with a recombinant DNA influenza vaccine and the 15 were
        inoculated with a placebo. Twelve of the 15 subjects in the placebo
        group (80%) eventually became infected with influenza whereas for the
        vaccine group, only 7 of the 15 subjects (47%) became infected. The
        data are tabulated as a 2 x 2 table::

                Vaccine  Placebo
            Yes     7        12
            No      8        3

    When working with statistical hypothesis testing, we usually use a
    threshold probability or significance level upon which we decide
    to reject the null hypothesis :math:`H_0`. Suppose we choose the common
    significance level of 5%.

    Our alternative hypothesis is that the vaccine will lower the chance of
    becoming infected with the virus; that is, the probability :math:`p_1` of
    catching the virus with the vaccine will be *less than* the probability
    :math:`p_2` of catching the virus without the vaccine.  Therefore, we call
    `barnard_exact` with the ``alternative="less"`` option:

    >>> import scipy.stats as stats
    >>> res = stats.barnard_exact([[7, 12], [8, 3]], alternative="less")
    >>> res.statistic
    -1.894...
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.03407...

    Under the null hypothesis that the vaccine will not lower the chance of
    becoming infected, the probability of obtaining test results at least as
    extreme as the observed data is approximately 3.4%. Since this p-value is
    less than our chosen significance level, we have evidence to reject
    :math:`H_0` in favor of the alternative.

    Suppose we had used Fisher's exact test instead:

    >>> _, pvalue = stats.fisher_exact([[7, 12], [8, 3]], alternative="less")
    >>> pvalue
    0.0640...

    With the same threshold significance of 5%, we would not have been able
    to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. As stated in
    [2]_, Barnard's test is uniformly more powerful than Fisher's exact test
    because Barnard's test does not condition on any margin. Fisher's test
    should only be used when both sets of marginals are fixed.

    Boschloo's exact test uses the p-value of Fisher's exact test as a

    hypothesis of observing such an extreme value of this statistic.

    Boschloo's and Barnard's are both more powerful than Fisher's exact

    Examples
    --------
    In the following example, we consider the article "Employee
    attitudes and job satisfaction" [3]_
    which reports the results of a survey from 63 scientists and 117 college
    professors. Of the 63 scientists, 31 said they were very satisfied with
    their jobs, whereas 74 of the college professors were very satisfied
    with their work. Is this significant evidence that college
    professors are happier with their work than scientists?
    The following table summarizes the data mentioned above::

                         college professors   scientists
        Very Satisfied   74                     31
        Dissatisfied     43                     32

    When working with statistical hypothesis testing, we usually use a
    threshold probability or significance level upon which we decide
    to reject the null hypothesis :math:`H_0`. Suppose we choose the common
    significance level of 5%.

    Our alternative hypothesis is that college professors are truly more
    satisfied with their work than scientists. Therefore, we expect
    :math:`p_1` the proportion of very satisfied college professors to be
    greater than :math:`p_2`, the proportion of very satisfied scientists.
    We thus call `boschloo_exact` with the ``alternative="greater"`` option:

    >>> import scipy.stats as stats
    >>> res = stats.boschloo_exact([[74, 31], [43, 32]], alternative="greater")
    >>> res.statistic
    0.0483...
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.0355...

    Under the null hypothesis that scientists are happier in their work than
    college professors, the probability of obtaining test
    results at least as extreme as the observed data is approximately 3.55%.
    Since this p-value is less than our chosen significance level, we have
    evidence to reject :math:`H_0` in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

    Returns
    -------
    p_value : float
        Return the maximum p-value considering every nuisance paramater
        between 0 and 1

    Notes
    -----

    Both Barnard's test and Boschloo's test iterate over a nuisance parameter
    :math:`\pi \in [0, 1]` to find the maximum p-value. To search this
    maxima, this function return the negative log pvalue with respect to the
    nuisance parameter passed in params. This negative log p-value is then
    used in `shgo` to find the minimum negative pvalue which is our maximum
    pvalue.

    Also, to compute the different combination used in the
    p-values' computation formula, this function uses `gammaln` which is
    more tolerant for large value than `scipy.special.comb`. `gammaln` gives
    a log combination. For the little precision loss, performances are
    improved a lot.

    Notes

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    The statistic is computed according to equation 9 in [2]_. The
    calculation of the p-value depends on the keyword `method`:

    - ``asymptotic``: The p-value is approximated by using the limiting
      distribution of the test statistic.
    - ``exact``: The exact p-value is computed by enumerating all
      possible combinations of the test statistic, see [2]_.

    The exact calculation will be very slow even for moderate sample
    sizes as the number of combinations increases rapidly with the
    size of the samples. If ``method=='auto'``, the exact approach
    is used if both samples contain less than 10 observations,
    otherwise the asymptotic distribution is used.

    If the underlying distribution is not continuous, the p-value is likely to
    be conservative (Section 6.2 in [3]_). When ranking the data to compute
    the test statistic, midranks are used if there are ties.

    Examples
    --------

    Suppose we wish to test whether two samples generated by
    ``scipy.stats.norm.rvs`` have the same distribution. We choose a
    significance level of alpha=0.05.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=100, random_state=rng)
    >>> y = stats.norm.rvs(size=70, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises_2samp(x, y)
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.29376470588235293, 0.1412873014573014)

    The p-value exceeds our chosen significance level, so we do not
    reject the null hypothesis that the observed samples are drawn from the
    same distribution.

    For small sample sizes, one can compute the exact p-values:

    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=7, random_state=rng)
    >>> y = stats.t.rvs(df=2, size=6, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises_2samp(x, y, method='exact')
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.197802197802198, 0.31643356643356646)

    The p-value based on the asymptotic distribution is a good approximation
    even though the sample size is small.

    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises_2samp(x, y, method='asymptotic')
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.197802197802198, 0.2966041181527128)

    Independent of the method, one would not reject the null hypothesis at the
    chosen significance level in this example.

    r"""
    Performs a permutation test of a given statistic on provided data.

    For independent sample statistics, the null hypothesis is that the data are
    randomly sampled from the same distribution.
    For paired sample statistics, two null hypothesis can be tested:
    that the data are paired at random or that the data are assigned to samples
    at random.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : iterable of array-like
        Contains the samples, each of which is an array of observations.
        Dimensions of sample arrays must be compatible for broadcasting except
        along `axis`.
    statistic : callable
        Statistic for which the p-value of the hypothesis test is to be
        calculated. `statistic` must be a callable that accepts samples
        as separate arguments (e.g. ``statistic(*data)``) and returns the
        resulting statistic.
        If `vectorized` is set ``True``, `statistic` must also accept a keyword
        argument `axis` and be vectorized to compute the statistic along the
        provided `axis` of the sample arrays.
    permutation_type : {'independent', 'samples', 'pairings'}, optional
        The type of permutations to be performed, in accordance with the
        null hypothesis. The first two permutation types are for paired sample
        statistics, in which all samples contain the same number of
        observations and observations with corresponding indices along `axis`
        are considered to be paired; the third is for independent sample
        statistics.

        - ``'samples'`` : observations are assigned to different samples
          but remain paired with the same observations from other samples.
          This permutation type is appropriate for paired sample hypothesis
          tests such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired t-test.
        - ``'pairings'`` : observations are paired with different observations,
          but they remain within the same sample. This permutation type is
          appropriate for association/correlation tests with statistics such
          as Spearman's :math:`\rho`, Kendall's :math:`\tau`, and Pearson's
          :math:`r`.
        - ``'independent'`` (default) : observations are assigned to different
          samples. Samples may contain different numbers of observations. This
          permutation type is appropriate for independent sample hypothesis
          tests such as the Mann-Whitney :math:`U` test and the independent
          sample t-test.

          Please see the Notes section below for more detailed descriptions
          of the permutation types.

    vectorized : bool, default: ``False``
        By default, `statistic` is assumed to calculate the statistic only for
        1D arrays contained in `data`. If `vectorized` is set ``True``,
        `statistic` must also accept a keyword argument `axis` and be
        vectorized to compute the statistic along the provided `axis` of the ND
        arrays in `data`. Use of a vectorized statistic can reduce computation
        time.
    n_resamples : int or np.inf, default: 9999
        Number of random permutations (resamples) used to approximate the null
        distribution. If greater than or equal to the number of distinct
        permutations, the exact null distribution will be computed.
        Note that the number of distinct permutations grows very rapidly with
        the sizes of samples, so exact tests are feasible only for very small
        data sets.
    batch : int, optional
        The number of permutations to process in each call to `statistic`.
        Memory usage is O(`batch`*``n``), where ``n`` is the total size
        of all samples, regardless of the value of `vectorized`. Default is
        ``None``, in which case ``batch`` is the number of permutations.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        The alternative hypothesis for which the p-value is calculated.
        For each alternative, the p-value is defined for exact tests as
        follows.

        - ``'greater'`` : the percentage of the null distribution that is
          greater than or equal to the observed value of the test statistic.
        - ``'less'`` : the percentage of the null distribution that is
          less than or equal to the observed value of the test statistic.
        - ``'two-sided'`` (default) : twice the smaller of the p-values above.

        Note that p-values for randomized tests are calculated according to the
        conservative (over-estimated) approximation suggested in [2]_ and [3]_
        rather than the unbiased estimator suggested in [4]_. That is, when
        calculating the proportion of the randomized null distribution that is
        as extreme as the observed value of the test statistic, the values in
        the numerator and denominator are both increased by one. An
        interpretation of this adjustment is that the observed value of the
        test statistic is always included as an element of the randomized
        null distribution.
        The convention used for two-sided p-values is not universal;
        the observed test statistic and null distribution are returned in
        case a different definition is preferred.

    axis : int, default: 0
        The axis of the (broadcasted) samples over which to calculate the
        statistic. If samples have a different number of dimensions,
        singleton dimensions are prepended to samples with fewer dimensions
        before `axis` is considered.
    random_state : {None, int, `numpy.random.Generator`,
                    `numpy.random.RandomState`}, optional

        Pseudorandom number generator state used to generate permutations.

        If `random_state` is ``None`` (default), the
        `numpy.random.RandomState` singleton is used.
        If `random_state` is an int, a new ``RandomState`` instance is used,
        seeded with `random_state`.
        If `random_state` is already a ``Generator`` or ``RandomState``
        instance then that instance is used.

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float or ndarray
        The observed test statistic of the data.
    pvalue : float or ndarray
        The p-value for the given alternative.
    null_distribution : ndarray
        The values of the test statistic generated under the null hypothesis.

    Notes
    -----

    The three types of permutation tests supported by this function are
    described below.

    **Unpaired statistics** (``permutation_type='independent'``):

    The null hypothesis associated with this permutation type is that all
    observations are sampled from the same underlying distribution and that
    they have been assigned to one of the samples at random.

    Suppose ``data`` contains two samples; e.g. ``a, b = data``.
    When ``1 < n_resamples < binom(n, k)``, where

    * ``k`` is the number of observations in ``a``,
    * ``n`` is the total number of observations in ``a`` and ``b``, and
    * ``binom(n, k)`` is the binomial coefficient (``n`` choose ``k``),

    the data are pooled (concatenated), randomly assigned to either the first
    or second sample, and the statistic is calculated. This process is
    performed repeatedly, `permutation` times, generating a distribution of the
    statistic under the null hypothesis. The statistic of the original
    data is compared to this distribution to determine the p-value.

    When ``n_resamples >= binom(n, k)``, an exact test is performed: the data
    are *partitioned* between the samples in each distinct way exactly once,
    and the exact null distribution is formed.
    Note that for a given partitioning of the data between the samples,
    only one ordering/permutation of the data *within* each sample is
    considered. For statistics that do not depend on the order of the data
    within samples, this dramatically reduces computational cost without
    affecting the shape of the null distribution (because the frequency/count
    of each value is affected by the same factor).

    For ``a = [a1, a2, a3, a4]`` and ``b = [b1, b2, b3]``, an example of this
    permutation type is ``x = [b3, a1, a2, b2]`` and ``y = [a4, b1, a3]``.
    Because only one ordering/permutation of the data *within* each sample
    is considered in an exact test, a resampling like ``x = [b3, a1, b2, a2]``
    and ``y = [a4, a3, b1]`` would *not* be considered distinct from the
    example above.

    ``permutation_type='independent'`` does not support one-sample statistics,
    but it can be applied to statistics with more than two samples. In this
    case, if ``n`` is an array of the number of observations within each
    sample, the number of distinct partitions is::

        np.product([binom(sum(n[i:]), sum(n[i+1:])) for i in range(len(n)-1)])

    **Paired statistics, permute pairings** (``permutation_type='pairings'``):

    The null hypothesis associated with this permutation type is that
    observations within each sample are drawn from the same underlying
    distribution and that pairings with elements of other samples are
    assigned at random.

    Suppose ``data`` contains only one sample; e.g. ``a, = data``, and we
    wish to consider all possible pairings of elements of ``a`` with elements
    of a second sample, ``b``. Let ``n`` be the number of observations in
    ``a``, which must also equal the number of observations in ``b``.

    When ``1 < n_resamples < factorial(n)``, the elements of ``a`` are
    randomly permuted. The user-supplied statistic accepts one data argument,
    say ``a_perm``, and calculates the statistic considering ``a_perm`` and
    ``b``. This process is performed repeatedly, `permutation` times,
    generating a distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis.
    The statistic of the original data is compared to this distribution to
    determine the p-value.

    When ``n_resamples >= factorial(n)``, an exact test is performed:
    ``a`` is permuted in each distinct way exactly once. Therefore, the
    `statistic` is computed for each unique pairing of samples between ``a``
    and ``b`` exactly once.

    For ``a = [a1, a2, a3]`` and ``b = [b1, b2, b3]``, an example of this
    permutation type is ``a_perm = [a3, a1, a2]`` while ``b`` is left
    in its original order.

    ``permutation_type='pairings'`` supports ``data`` containing any number
    of samples, each of which must contain the same number of observations.
    All samples provided in ``data`` are permuted *independently*. Therefore,
    if ``m`` is the number of samples and ``n`` is the number of observations
    within each sample, then the number of permutations in an exact test is::

        factorial(n)**m

    Note that if a two-sample statistic, for example, does not inherently
    depend on the order in which observations are provided - only on the
    *pairings* of observations - then only one of the two samples should be
    provided in ``data``. This dramatically reduces computational cost without
    affecting the shape of the null distribution (because the frequency/count
    of each value is affected by the same factor).

    **Paired statistics, permute samples** (``permutation_type='samples'``):

    The null hypothesis associated with this permutation type is that
    observations within each pair are drawn from the same underlying
    distribution and that the sample to which they are assigned is random.

    Suppose ``data`` contains two samples; e.g. ``a, b = data``.
    Let ``n`` be the number of observations in ``a``, which must also equal
    the number of observations in ``b``.

    When ``1 < n_resamples < 2**n``, the elements of ``a`` are ``b`` are
    randomly swapped between samples (maintaining their pairings) and the
    statistic is calculated. This process is performed repeatedly,
    `permutation` times,  generating a distribution of the statistic under the
    null hypothesis. The statistic of the original data is compared to this
    distribution to determine the p-value.

    When ``n_resamples >= 2**n``, an exact test is performed: the observations
    are assigned to the two samples in each distinct way (while maintaining
    pairings) exactly once.

    For ``a = [a1, a2, a3]`` and ``b = [b1, b2, b3]``, an example of this
    permutation type is ``x = [b1, a2, b3]`` and ``y = [a1, b2, a3]``.

    ``permutation_type='samples'`` supports ``data`` containing any number
    of samples, each of which must contain the same number of observations.
    If ``data`` contains more than one sample, paired observations within
    ``data`` are exchanged between samples *independently*. Therefore, if ``m``
    is the number of samples and ``n`` is the number of observations within
    each sample, then the number of permutations in an exact test is::

        factorial(m)**n

    Several paired-sample statistical tests, such as the Wilcoxon signed rank
    test and paired-sample t-test, can be performed considering only the
    *difference* between two paired elements. Accordingly, if ``data`` contains
    only one sample, then the null distribution is formed by independently
    changing the *sign* of each observation.

    Examples
    --------

    Suppose we wish to test whether two samples are drawn from the same
    distribution. Assume that the underlying distributions are unknown to us,
    and that before observing the data, we hypothesized that the mean of the
    first sample would be less than that of the second sample. We decide that
    we will use the difference between the sample means as a test statistic,
    and we will consider a p-value of 0.05 to be statistically significant.

    For efficiency, we write the function defining the test statistic in a
    vectorized fashion: the samples ``x`` and ``y`` can be ND arrays, and the
    statistic will be calculated for each axis-slice along `axis`.

    >>> def statistic(x, y, axis):
    ...     return np.mean(x, axis=axis) - np.mean(y, axis=axis)

    After collecting our data, we calculate the observed value of the test
    statistic.

    >>> from scipy.stats import norm
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> x = norm.rvs(size=5, random_state=rng)
    >>> y = norm.rvs(size=6, loc = 3, random_state=rng)
    >>> statistic(x, y, 0)
    -3.5411688580987266

    Indeed, the test statistic is negative, suggesting that the true mean of
    the distribution underlying ``x`` is less than that of the distribution
    underlying ``y``. To determine the probability of this occuring by chance
    if the two samples were drawn from the same distribution, we perform
    a permutation test.

    >>> from scipy.stats import permutation_test
    >>> # because our statistic is vectorized, we pass `vectorized=True`
    >>> # `n_resamples=np.inf` indicates that an exact test is to be performed
    >>> res = permutation_test((x, y), statistic, vectorized=True,
    ...                        n_resamples=np.inf, alternative='less')
    >>> print(res.statistic)
    -3.5411688580987266
    >>> print(res.pvalue)
    0.004329004329004329

    The probability of obtaining a test statistic less than or equal to the
    observed value under the null hypothesis is 0.4329%. This is less than our
    chosen threshold of 5%, so we consider this to to be significant evidence
    against the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

    Because the size of the samples above was small, `permutation_test` could
    perform an exact test. For larger samples, we resort to a randomized
    permutation test.

    >>> x = norm.rvs(size=100, random_state=rng)
    >>> y = norm.rvs(size=120, loc=0.3, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = permutation_test((x, y), statistic, n_resamples=100000,
    ...                        vectorized=True, alternative='less',
    ...                        random_state=rng)
    >>> print(res.statistic)
    -0.5230459671240913
    >>> print(res.pvalue)
    0.00016999830001699983

    The approximate probability of obtaining a test statistic less than or
    equal to the observed value under the null hypothesis is 0.0225%. This is
    again less than our chosen threshold of 5%, so again we have significant
    evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

    For large samples and number of permutations, the result is comparable to
    that of the corresponding asymptotic test, the independent sample t-test.

    >>> from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
    >>> res_asymptotic = ttest_ind(x, y, alternative='less')
    >>> print(res_asymptotic.pvalue)
    0.00012688101537979522

    The permutation distribution of the test statistic is provided for
    further investigation.

    >>> plt.hist(res.null_distribution, bins=50)

    """Perform Tukey's HSD test for equality of means over multiple treatments.

    Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test performs pairwise
    comparison of means for a set of samples. Whereas ANOVA (e.g. `f_oneway`)
    assesses whether the true means underlying each sample are identical,
    Tukey's HSD is a post hoc test used to compare the mean of each sample
    to the mean of each other sample.

    The null hypothesis is that the distributions underlying the samples all
    have the same mean. The test statistic, which is computed for every
    possible pairing of samples, is simply the difference between the sample
    means. For each pair, the p-value is the probability under the null
    hypothesis (and other assumptions; see notes) of observing such an extreme
    value of the statistic, considering that many pairwise comparisons are
    being performed. Confidence intervals for the difference between each pair
    of means are also available.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1, sample2, ... : array_like
        The sample measurements for each group. There must be at least
        two arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    result : `~scipy.stats._result_classes.TukeyHSDResult` instance
        The return value is an object with the following attributes:

        statistic : float ndarray
            The computed statistic of the test for each comparison. The element
            at index ``(i, j)`` is the statistic for the comparison between
            groups ``i`` and ``j``.
        pvalue : float ndarray
            The computed p-value of the test for each comparison. The element
            at index ``(i, j)`` is the p-value for the comparison between
            groups ``i`` and ``j``.

        The object has the following methods:

        confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.95):
            Compute the confidence interval for the specified confidence level.

    Notes
    -----
    The use of this test relies on several assumptions.

    1. The observations are independent within and among groups.
    2. The observations within each group are normally distributed.
    3. The distributions from which the samples are drawn have the same finite
       variance.

    The original formulation of the test was for samples of equal size [6]_.
    In case of unequal sample sizes, the test uses the Tukey-Kramer method
    [4]_.

    Examples
    --------
    Here are some data comparing the time to relief of three brands of
    headache medicine, reported in minutes. Data adapted from [3]_.

    >>> from scipy.stats import tukey_hsd
    >>> group0 = [24.5, 23.5, 26.4, 27.1, 29.9]
    >>> group1 = [28.4, 34.2, 29.5, 32.2, 30.1]
    >>> group2 = [26.1, 28.3, 24.3, 26.2, 27.8]

    We would like to see if the means between any of the groups are
    significantly different. First, visually examine a box and whisker plot.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
    >>> ax.boxplot([group0, group1, group2])
    >>> ax.set_xticklabels(["group0", "group1", "group2"]) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.set_ylabel("mean") # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.show()

    From the box and whisker plot, we can see overlap in the interquartile
    ranges group 1 to group 2 and group 3, but we can apply the ``tukey_hsd``
    test to determine if the difference between means is significant. We
    set a significance level of .05 to reject the null hypothesis.

    >>> res = tukey_hsd(group0, group1, group2)
    >>> print(res)
    Tukey's HSD Pairwise Group Comparisons (95.0% Confidence Interval)
    Comparison  Statistic  p-value   Lower CI   Upper CI
    (0 - 1)     -4.600      0.014     -8.249     -0.951
    (0 - 2)     -0.260      0.980     -3.909      3.389
    (1 - 0)      4.600      0.014      0.951      8.249
    (1 - 2)      4.340      0.020      0.691      7.989
    (2 - 0)      0.260      0.980     -3.389      3.909
    (2 - 1)     -4.340      0.020     -7.989     -0.691

    The null hypothesis is that each group has the same mean. The p-value for
    comparisons between ``group0`` and ``group1`` as well as ``group1`` and
    ``group2`` do not exceed .05, so we reject the null hypothesis that they
    have the same means. The p-value of the comparison between ``group0``
    and ``group2`` exceeds .05, so we accept the null hypothesis that there
    is not a significant difference between their means.

    We can also compute the confidence interval associated with our chosen
    confidence level.

    >>> group0 = [24.5, 23.5, 26.4, 27.1, 29.9]
    >>> group1 = [28.4, 34.2, 29.5, 32.2, 30.1]
    >>> group2 = [26.1, 28.3, 24.3, 26.2, 27.8]
    >>> result = tukey_hsd(group0, group1, group2)
    >>> conf = res.confidence_interval(confidence_level=.99)
    >>> for ((i, j), l) in np.ndenumerate(conf.low):
    ...     # filter out self comparisons
    ...     if i != j:
