            #    not more than GAMMA3*RHOEND; RHO remains unchanged in all other cases;
            #    in particular, RHO is never increased.
            # 2. Our implementation uses DELTA as the trust-region radius, while using
            #    RHO as a lower bound for DELTA. DELTA is updated in a way that is
            #    typical for trust-region methods, and it is revised to RHO if its new
            #    value is not more than GAMMA3*RHO. RHO reflects the current resolution
            #    of the algorithm; its update is essentially the same as the update of
            #    RHO in Powell's code (see the definition of REDUCE_RHO below). Our

            # 3. The same as Powell's code, we do not reduce RHO unless ADEQUATE_GEO is
            #    TRUE. This is also how Powell updated RHO in
            #    UOBYQA/NEWUOA/BOBYQA/LINCOA. What about we also use ADEQUATE_GEO ==
            #    TRUE as a prerequisite for reducing DELTA? The argument would be that
            #    the bad (small) value of RATIO may be because of a bad geometry (and
            #    hence a bad model) rather than an improperly large DELTA, and it might
            #    be good to try improving the geometry first without reducing DELTA.
            #    However, according to a test on 20230206, it does not improve the
            #    performance if we skip the update of DELTA when ADEQUATE_GEO is FALSE

        # 1. Powell's definition of BAD_TRSTEP is as follows. The one used above seems to work better,
        # especially for linearly constrained problems due to the factor TENTH (= ETA1).
        # !bad_trstep = (shortd .or. actrem <= 0 .or. actrem < TENTH * prerem .or. jdrop_tr == 0)
        # Besides, Powell did not check PREREM > 0 in BAD_TRSTEP, which is reasonable to do but has
        # little impact upon the performance.
        # 2. NEWUOA/BOBYQA/LINCOA would define BAD_TRSTEP, IMPROVE_GEO, and REDUCE_RHO as follows. Two
        # different thresholds are used in BAD_TRSTEP. It outperforms Powell's version.
        # !bad_trstep = (shortd .or. trfail .or. ratio <= eta1 .or. jdrop_tr == 0)
        # !improve_geo = bad_trstep .and. .not. adequate_geo
        # !bad_trstep = (shortd .or. trfail .or. ratio <= 0 .or. jdrop_tr == 0)
        # !reduce_rho = bad_trstep .and. adequate_geo .and. max(delta, dnorm) <= rho
        # 3. Theoretically, JDROP_TR > 0 when ACTREM > 0 (guaranteed by RATIO > 0). However, in Powell's
        # implementation, JDROP_TR may be 0 even RATIO > 0 due to NaN. The modernized code has rectified
        # this in the function SETDROP_TR. After this rectification, we can indeed simplify the
        # definition of BAD_TRSTEP by removing the condition JDROP_TR == 0. We retain it for robustness.

        # Comments on REDUCE_RHO:
        # When SHORTD is TRUE, UOBYQA/NEWUOA/BOBYQA/LINCOA all set REDUCE_RHO to TRUE if the recent
        # models are sufficiently accurate according to certain criteria. See the paragraph around (37)
        # in the UOBYQA paper and the discussions about Box 14 in the NEWUOA paper. This strategy is
        # crucial for the performance of the solvers. However, as of 20221111, we have not managed to
        # make it work in COBYLA. As in NEWUOA, we recorded the errors of the recent models, and set
        # REDUCE_RHO to true if they are small (e.g., ALL(ABS(MODERR_REC) <= 0.1 * MAXVAL(ABS(A))*RHO) or
        # ALL(ABS(MODERR_REC) <= RHO**2)) when SHORTD is TRUE. It made little impact on the performance.

        # Since COBYLA never sets IMPROVE_GEO and REDUCE_RHO to TRUE simultaneously, the following
        # two blocks are exchangeable: IF (IMPROVE_GEO) ... END IF and IF (REDUCE_RHO) ... END IF.

        # Improve the geometry of the simplex by removing a point and adding a new one.
        # If the current interpolation set has acceptable geometry, then we skip the geometry step.
        # The code has a small difference from Powell's original code here: If the current geometry
        # is acceptable, then we will continue with a new trust-region iteration; however, at the
        # beginning of the iteration, CPEN may be updated, which may alter the pole point SIM(:, N+1)
        # by UPDATEPOLE; the quality of the interpolation point depends on SIM(:, N + 1), meaning
        # that the same interpolation set may have good or bad geometry with respect to different
        # "poles"; if the geometry turns out bad with the new pole, the original COBYLA code will
        # take a geometry step, but our code here will NOT do it but continue to take a trust-region
        # step. The argument is this: even if the geometry step is not skipped in the first place, the
        # geometry may turn out bad again after the pole is altered due to an update to CPEN; should
        # we take another geometry step in that case? If no, why should we do it here? Indeed, this
        # distinction makes no practical difference for CUTEst problems with at most 100 variables
        # and 5000 constraints, while the algorithm framework is simplified.

            # Decide a vertex to drop from the simplex. It will be replaced with SIM[:, NUM_VARS] + D to
            # improve the geometry of the simplex.
            # N.B.:
            # 1. COBYLA never sets JDROP_GEO = num_vars.
            # 2. The following JDROP_GEO comes from UOBYQA/NEWUOA/BOBYQA/LINCOA.
            # 3. In Powell's original algorithm, the geometry of the simplex is considered acceptable
            # iff the distance between any vertex and the pole is at most 2.1*DELTA, and the distance
            # between any vertex and the opposite face of the simplex is at least 0.25*DELTA, as
            # specified in (14) of the COBYLA paper. Correspondingly, JDROP_GEO is set to the index of
            # the vertex with the largest distance to the pole provided that the distance is larger than
            # 2.1*DELTA, or the vertex with the smallest distance to the opposite face of the simplex,
            # in which case the distance must be less than 0.25*DELTA, as the current simplex does not
            # have acceptable geometry (see (15)--(16) of the COBYLA paper). Once JDROP_GEO is set, the
            # algorithm replaces SIM(:, JDROP_GEO) with D specified in (17) of the COBYLA paper, which
            # is orthogonal to the face opposite to SIM(:, JDROP_GEO) and has a length of 0.5*DELTA,
            # intending to improve the geometry of the simplex as per (14).
            # 4. Powell's geometry-improving procedure outlined above has an intrinsic flaw: it may lead
            # to infinite cycling, as was observed in a test on 20240320. In this test, the geometry-
            # improving point introduced in the previous iteration was replaced with the trust-region
            # trial point in the current iteration, which was then replaced with the same geometry-
            # improving point in the next iteration, and so on. In this process, the simplex alternated
            # between two configurations, neither of which had acceptable geometry. Thus RHO was never
            # reduced, leading to infinite cycling. (N.B.: Our implementation uses DELTA as the trust
            # region radius, with RHO being its lower bound. When the infinite cycling occurred in this
            # test, DELTA = RHO and it could not be reduced due to the requirement that DELTA >= RHO.)

    # Note the following:
    # 1. In each loop, CPEN is changed only if PREREC > 0 > PREREF, in which case
    #    PREREM is guaranteed positive after the update. Note that PREREC >= 0 and
    #    max(PREREC, PREREF) > 0 in theory. If this holds numerically as well then CPEN
    #    is not changed only if PREREC = 0 or PREREF >= 0, in which case PREREM is
    #    currently positive, explaining why CPEN needs no update.
    # 2. Even without an upper bound for the loop counter, the loop can occur at most
    #    NUM_VARS+1 times. This is because the update of CPEN does not decrease CPEN,
    #    and hence it can make vertex J (J <= NUM_VARS) become the new optimal vertex
    #    only if CVAL[J] is less than CVAL[NUM_VARS], which can happen at most NUM_VARS
    #    times. See the paragraph below (9) in the COBYLA paper. After the "correct"
    #    optimal vertex is found, one more loop is needed to calculate CPEN, and hence
    #    the loop can occur at most NUM_VARS+1 times.
