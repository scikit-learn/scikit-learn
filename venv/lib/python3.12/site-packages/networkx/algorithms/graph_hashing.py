    """Return Weisfeiler Lehman (WL) graph hash.

    .. Warning:: Hash values for directed graphs and graphs without edge or
        node attributes have changed in v3.5. In previous versions,
        directed graphs did not distinguish in- and outgoing edges. Also,
        graphs without attributes set initial states such that effectively
        one extra iteration of WL occurred than indicated by `iterations`.
        For undirected graphs without node or edge labels, the old
        hashes can be obtained by increasing the iteration count by one.
        For more details, see `issue #7806
        <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7806>`_.

    The function iteratively aggregates and hashes neighborhoods of each node.
    After each node's neighbors are hashed to obtain updated node labels,
    a hashed histogram of resulting labels is returned as the final hash.

    Hashes are identical for isomorphic graphs and strong guarantees that
    non-isomorphic graphs will get different hashes. See [1]_ for details.

    If no node or edge attributes are provided, the degree of each node
    is used as its initial label.
    Otherwise, node and/or edge labels are used to compute the hash.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        The graph to be hashed.
        Can have node and/or edge attributes. Can also have no attributes.
    edge_attr : string, optional (default=None)
        The key in edge attribute dictionary to be used for hashing.
        If None, edge labels are ignored.
    node_attr: string, optional (default=None)
        The key in node attribute dictionary to be used for hashing.
        If None, and no edge_attr given, use the degrees of the nodes as labels.
    iterations: int, optional (default=3)
        Number of neighbor aggregations to perform.
        Should be larger for larger graphs.
    digest_size: int, optional (default=16)
        Size (in bytes) of blake2b hash digest to use for hashing node labels.

    Returns
    -------
    h : string
        Hexadecimal string corresponding to hash of `G` (length ``2 * digest_size``).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `iterations` is not a positve number.

    Examples
    --------
    Two graphs with edge attributes that are isomorphic, except for
    differences in the edge labels.

    >>> G1 = nx.Graph()
    >>> G1.add_edges_from(
    ...     [
    ...         (1, 2, {"label": "A"}),
    ...         (2, 3, {"label": "A"}),
    ...         (3, 1, {"label": "A"}),
    ...         (1, 4, {"label": "B"}),
    ...     ]
    ... )
    >>> G2 = nx.Graph()
    >>> G2.add_edges_from(
    ...     [
    ...         (5, 6, {"label": "B"}),
    ...         (6, 7, {"label": "A"}),
    ...         (7, 5, {"label": "A"}),
    ...         (7, 8, {"label": "A"}),
    ...     ]
    ... )

    Omitting the `edge_attr` option, results in identical hashes.

    >>> nx.weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash(G1)
    'c045439172215f49e0bef8c3d26c6b61'
    >>> nx.weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash(G2)
    'c045439172215f49e0bef8c3d26c6b61'

    With edge labels, the graphs are no longer assigned
    the same hash digest.

    >>> nx.weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash(G1, edge_attr="label")
    'c653d85538bcf041d88c011f4f905f10'
    >>> nx.weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash(G2, edge_attr="label")
    '3dcd84af1ca855d0eff3c978d88e7ec7'

    Notes
    -----
    To return the WL hashes of each subgraph of a graph, use
    `weisfeiler_lehman_subgraph_hashes`

    Similarity between hashes does not imply similarity between graphs.

    Return a dictionary of subgraph hashes by node.

    .. Warning:: Hash values for directed graphs have changed in version
        v3.5. In previous versions, directed graphs did not distinguish in-
        and outgoing edges.
        Graphs without attributes previously performed an extra iteration of
        WL at initialisation, which was not visible in the output of this
        function. This hash value is now included in the returned dictionary,
        shifting the other calculated hashes one position to the right. To
        obtain the same last subgraph hash, increase the number of iterations
        by one.
        For more details, see `issue #7806
        <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7806>`_.

    Dictionary keys are nodes in `G`, and values are a list of hashes.
    Each hash corresponds to a subgraph rooted at a given node u in `G`.
    Lists of subgraph hashes are sorted in increasing order of depth from
    their root node, with the hash at index i corresponding to a subgraph
    of nodes at most i-hops (i edges) distance from u. Thus, each list will contain
    `iterations` elements - a hash for a subgraph at each depth. If
    `include_initial_labels` is set to `True`, each list will additionally
    have contain a hash of the initial node label (or equivalently a
    subgraph of depth 0) prepended, totalling ``iterations + 1`` elements.

    The function iteratively aggregates and hashes neighborhoods of each node.
    This is achieved for each step by replacing for each node its label from
    the previous iteration with its hashed 1-hop neighborhood aggregate.
    The new node label is then appended to a list of node labels for each
    node.

    To aggregate neighborhoods for a node $u$ at each step, all labels of
    nodes adjacent to $u$ are concatenated. If the `edge_attr` parameter is set,
    labels for each neighboring node are prefixed with the value of this attribute
    along the connecting edge from this neighbor to node $u$. The resulting string
    is then hashed to compress this information into a fixed digest size.

    Thus, at the i-th iteration, nodes within i hops influence any given
    hashed node label. We can therefore say that at depth $i$ for node $u$
    we have a hash for a subgraph induced by the i-hop neighborhood of $u$.

    The output can be used to create general Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels,
    or generate features for graphs or nodes - for example to generate 'words' in
    a graph as seen in the 'graph2vec' algorithm.
    See [1]_ & [2]_ respectively for details.

    Hashes are identical for isomorphic subgraphs and there exist strong
    guarantees that non-isomorphic graphs will get different hashes.
    See [1]_ for details.

    If no node or edge attributes are provided, the degree of each node
    is used as its initial label.
    Otherwise, node and/or edge labels are used to compute the hash.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        The graph to be hashed.
        Can have node and/or edge attributes. Can also have no attributes.
    edge_attr : string, optional (default=None)
        The key in edge attribute dictionary to be used for hashing.
        If None, edge labels are ignored.
    node_attr : string, optional (default=None)
        The key in node attribute dictionary to be used for hashing.
        If None, and no edge_attr given, use the degrees of the nodes as labels.
        If None, and edge_attr is given, each node starts with an identical label.
    iterations : int, optional (default=3)
        Number of neighbor aggregations to perform.
        Should be larger for larger graphs.
    digest_size : int, optional (default=16)
        Size (in bytes) of blake2b hash digest to use for hashing node labels.
        The default size is 16 bytes.
    include_initial_labels : bool, optional (default=False)
        If True, include the hashed initial node label as the first subgraph
        hash for each node.

    Returns
    -------
    node_subgraph_hashes : dict
        A dictionary with each key given by a node in G, and each value given
        by the subgraph hashes in order of depth from the key node.
        Hashes are hexadecimal strings (hence ``2 * digest_size`` long).


    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `iterations` is not a positve number.

    Examples
    --------
    Finding similar nodes in different graphs:

    >>> G1 = nx.Graph()
    >>> G1.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7)])
    >>> G2 = nx.Graph()
    >>> G2.add_edges_from([(1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 6), (1, 5), (4, 6)])
    >>> g1_hashes = nx.weisfeiler_lehman_subgraph_hashes(
    ...     G1, iterations=4, digest_size=8
    ... )
    >>> g2_hashes = nx.weisfeiler_lehman_subgraph_hashes(
    ...     G2, iterations=4, digest_size=8
    ... )

    Even though G1 and G2 are not isomorphic (they have different numbers of edges),
    the hash sequence of depth 3 for node 1 in G1 and node 5 in G2 are similar:

    >>> g1_hashes[1]
    ['f6fc42039fba3776', 'a93b64973cfc8897', 'db1b43ae35a1878f', '57872a7d2059c1c0']
    >>> g2_hashes[5]
    ['f6fc42039fba3776', 'a93b64973cfc8897', 'db1b43ae35a1878f', '1716d2a4012fa4bc']

    The first 3 WL subgraph hashes match. From this we can conclude that it's very
    likely the neighborhood of 3 hops around these nodes are isomorphic.

    However the 4-hop neighborhoods of ``G1`` and ``G2`` are not isomorphic since the
    4th hashes in the lists above are not equal.

    These nodes may be candidates to be classified together since their local topology
    is similar.

    Notes
    -----
    To hash the full graph when subgraph hashes are not needed, use
    `weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash` for efficiency.

    Similarity between hashes does not imply similarity between graphs.
