    A *dominating set* for a graph with node set *V* is a subset *D* of

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    start_with : node (default=None)
        Node to use as a starting point for the algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    D : set
        A dominating set for G.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is an implementation of algorithm 7 in [2]_ which
    finds some dominating set, not necessarily the smallest one.

    Notes
    -----
    This function implements Algorithm I in its basic version as described
    in [3]_. The idea behind the algorithm is the following: grow a tree *T*,
    starting from a node with maximum degree. Throughout the growing process,
    nonleaf nodes in *T* are our connected dominating set (CDS), leaf nodes in
    *T* are marked as "seen" and nodes in G that are not yet in *T* are marked as
    "unseen". We maintain a max-heap of all "seen" nodes, and track the number
    of "unseen" neighbors for each node. At each step we pop the heap top -- a
    "seen" (leaf) node with maximal number of "unseen" neighbors, add it to the
    CDS and mark all its "unseen" neighbors as "seen". For each one of the newly
    created "seen" nodes, we also decrement the number of "unseen" neighbors for
    all its neighbors. The algorithm terminates when there are no more "unseen"
    nodes.
    Runtime complexity of this implementation is $O(|E|*log|V|)$ (amortized).
