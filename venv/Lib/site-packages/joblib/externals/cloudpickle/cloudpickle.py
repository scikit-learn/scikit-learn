"""
This class is defined to override standard pickle functionality

The goals of it follow:
-Serialize lambdas and nested functions to compiled byte code
-Deal with main module correctly
-Deal with other non-serializable objects

It does not include an unpickler, as standard python unpickling suffices.

    need a special introspection technique that does not rely on GLOBAL-related
    opcodes to find references of them in a code object.

def cell_set(cell, value):
    """Set the value of a closure cell.

    The point of this function is to set the cell_contents attribute of a cell
    after its creation. This operation is necessary in case the cell contains a
    reference to the function the cell belongs to, as when calling the
    function's constructor
    ``f = types.FunctionType(code, globals, name, argdefs, closure)``,
    closure will not be able to contain the yet-to-be-created f.

    In Python3.7, cell_contents is writeable, so setting the contents of a cell
    can be done simply using
    >>> cell.cell_contents = value

    In earlier Python3 versions, the cell_contents attribute of a cell is read
    only, but this limitation can be worked around by leveraging the Python 3
    ``nonlocal`` keyword.

    In Python2 however, this attribute is read only, and there is no
    ``nonlocal`` keyword. For this reason, we need to come up with more
    complicated hacks to set this attribute.

    The chosen approach is to create a function with a STORE_DEREF opcode,
    which sets the content of a closure variable. Typically:

    >>> def inner(value):
    ...     lambda: cell  # the lambda makes cell a closure
    ...     cell = value  # cell is a closure, so this triggers a STORE_DEREF

    (Note that in Python2, A STORE_DEREF can never be triggered from an inner
    function. The function g for example here
    >>> def f(var):
    ...     def g():
    ...         var += 1
    ...     return g

    will not modify the closure variable ``var```inplace, but instead try to
    load a local variable var and increment it. As g does not assign the local
    variable ``var`` any initial value, calling f(1)() will fail at runtime.)

    Our objective is to set the value of a given cell ``cell``. So we need to
    somewhat reference our ``cell`` object into the ``inner`` function so that
    this object (and not the smoke cell of the lambda function) gets affected
    by the STORE_DEREF operation.

    In inner, ``cell`` is referenced as a cell variable (an enclosing variable
    that is referenced by the inner function). If we create a new function
    cell_set with the exact same code as ``inner``, but with ``cell`` marked as
    a free variable instead, the STORE_DEREF will be applied on its closure -
    ``cell``, which we can specify explicitly during construction! The new
    cell_set variable thus actually sets the contents of a specified cell!

    Note: we do not make use of the ``nonlocal`` keyword to set the contents of
    a cell in early python3 versions to limit possible syntax errors in case
    test and checker libraries decide to parse the whole file.
