This is a community effort, and as such many people have contributed
to it over the years.

History

David Cournapeau. Later that year, Matthieu Brucher started work on
this project as part of his thesis.

In 2010 Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and
Vincent Michel took leadership of the project and made the first
public release, February the 1st 2010. Since then, several releases
have appeard following a ~3 month cycle.
